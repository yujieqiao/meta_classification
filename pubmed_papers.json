For this purpose we have developed a highly detailed model of the distribution and densities of membrane ion channels in hippocampal CA3 bursting and nonbursting pyramidal neurons. This model reproduces both the experimentally observed firing modes and the dynamics of intracellular Ca2+. 3. The kinetics of the membrane ionic conductances are based on available experimental data. This model incorporates a single Na+ channel, three Ca2+ channels (CaN, CaL, and CaT), three Ca(2+)-independent K+ channels (KDR, KA, and KM), two Ca(2+)-dependent K+ channels (KC and KAHP), and intracellular Ca(2+)-related processes such as buffering, pumping, and radial diffusion. 4. To test the robustness of the model, we applied it to six different morphologically accurate reconstructions of CA3 hippocampal pyramidal neurons. In every neuron, Ca2+ channels, Ca(2+)-related processes, and Ca(2+)-dependent K+ channels were uniformly distributed over the entire cell. Ca(2+)-independent K+ channels were placed on the soma and the proximal apical dendrites. For each reconstructed cell we were able to reproduce bursting and nonbursting firing characteristics as well as Ca2+ transients and distributions for both somatic and synaptic stimulations. 5. Our simulation results suggest that CA3 pyramidal cell bursting behavior does not require any special distribution of Ca(2+)-dependent channels and mechanisms. Furthermore, a simple increase in the Ca(2+)-independent K+ conductances is sufficient to change the firing mode of our CA3 neurons from bursting to nonbursting. 6.

A network model of thalamocortical (TC) and thalamic reticular (RE) neurons was developed based on electrophysiological measurements in ferret thalamic slices. Single-compartment TC and RE cells included voltage- and calcium-sensitive currents described by Hodgkin-Huxley type of kinetics. Synaptic currents were modeled by kinetic models of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA), gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABAA) and GABAB receptors. 2. The model reproduced successfully the characteristics of spindle and slow bicuculline-induced oscillations observed in vitro. The characteristics of these two types of oscillations depended on both the intrinsic properties of TC and RE cells and their pattern of interconnectivity. 3. The oscillations were organized by the reciprocal recruitment between TC and RE cells, due to their manual connectivity and bursting properties. TC cells elicited AMPA-mediated excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in RE cells, whereas RE cells elicited a mixture of GABAA and GABAB inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) in TC cells. Because of the presence of a T current, sufficiently strong EPSPs could elicit a burst in RE cells, and TC cells could generate a rebound burst following GABAergic IPSPs. Under these conditions, interaction between the TC and RE cells produced sustained oscillations. 4. In the absence of spontaneous oscillation in any cell, the TC-RE network remained quiescent. Spindle oscillations with a frequency of 9-11 Hz could be initiated by stimulation of either TC or RE neurons. A few spontaneously oscillating TC neurons recruited the entire network model into a \"waxing-and waning\" oscillation. These \"initiator\" cells could be an extremely small proportion of TC cells. 5. In intracellular recordings, TC cells display a reduced ability for burst firing after a sequence of bursts. The \"waning\" phase of spindles was reproduced in the network model by assuming an activity-dependent upregulation of Ih operating via a calcium-binding protein in TC cells, as shown previously in a two-cell model. 6. Following the global suppression of GABAA inhibition, the disinhibited RE cells produced prolonged burst discharges that elicited strong GABAB-mediated currents in TC cells. The enhancement of slow IPSPs in TC cells was also due to cooperativity in the activation of GABAB-mediated current. These slow IPSPs recruited TC and RE cells into slower waxing-and-waning oscillations (3-4 HZ) that were even more highly synchronized. 7. Local axonal arborization of the TC to RE and RE to TC projections allowed oscillations to propagate through the network. An oscillation starting at a single focus induced a propagating wavefront as more cells were recruited progressively. The waning of the oscillation also propagated due to upregulation of Ih in TC cells, leading to waves of spindle activity as observed in experiments. 8. The spatiotemporal properties of propagating waves in the model were highly dependent on the intrinsic properties of TC cells. The spatial pattern of spiking activity was markedly different for spindles compared with bicuculline-induced oscillations and depended on the rebound burst behavior of TC cells. The upregulation of Ih produced a refractory period so that colliding spindle waves merged into a single oscillation and extinguished. Finally, reducing the Ih conductance led to sustained oscillations. 9. Two key properties of cells in the thalamic network may account for the initiation, propagation, and termination of spindle oscillations, the activity-dependent upregulation of Ih in TC cells, and the localized axonal projections between TC and RE cells. In addition, the model predicts that a nonlinear stimulus dependency of GABAB responses accounts for the genesis of prolonged synchronized discharges following block of GABAA receptors."}], "ArticleTitle": "Ionic mechanisms underlying synchronized oscillations and propagating waves in a model of ferret thalamic slices."}}, "3344": {"1491259": {"mesh": ["4-Aminopyridine", "Aging", "Animals", "Animals, Newborn", "Barium", "Cadmium", "Electrophysiology", "Hippocampus", "In Vitro Techniques", "Kinetics", "Neurons", "Potassium Channels", "Rats", "Rats, Wistar", "Tetraethylammonium Compounds"], "AbstractText": [{"section": null, "text": "1.

The early peak of the composite K+ outward current was larger in layer I neurons. 3.

The second component, termed the delayed rectifier or I(DR), activated relatively slowly and did not decay significantly during a 200-ms test pulse. I(DR) was insensitive to blocking by 4-AP at concentrations up to 4 mM and blocked by > 60% by 40-60 mM TEA. 4. I(A) kinetics were examined in the presence of 40-60 mM TEA.

The IK,Ca was modeled to respond to Ca influx, and a variable-rate Ca-sequestering mechanism was implemented to remove cytoplasmic calcium. Impulse frequency increases when either ICa or IK,Ca is eliminated from the model or blocked pharmacologically in whole cell recording experiments. Faithful simulations of experimental data show that the ionic currents may be grouped into small (IK,Ca, leakage, and stimulus), and large (INa, IK, IA, ICa) on the basis of their peak magnitudes throughout the impulse train. This division of the currents is reflected in their function of controlling the interspike interval (small currents) and impulse generation (large currents).

The activation curve of the conductance underlying Ih was obtained through analysis of tail currents and ranged from -60 to -90 mV, with half-activation occurring at -75 mV. The time course of activation of Ih was well fitted by a single-exponential function and was strongly voltage dependent, with time constants ranging from greater than 1-2 s at threshold to an average of 229 ms at -95 mV.

To understand how dendritic active properties are involved in this transmission, we have combined dual soma and dendritic patch recordings with computational modeling to analyze action-potential initiation and propagation in the primary dendrite. In response to depolarizing current injection or distal olfactory nerve input, fast Na(+) action potentials were recorded along the entire length of the primary dendritic trunk. With weak-to-moderate olfactory nerve input, an action potential was initiated near the soma and then back-propagated into the primary dendrite. As olfactory nerve input increased, the initiation site suddenly shifted to the distal primary dendrite. Multi-compartmental modeling indicated that this abrupt shift of the spike-initiation site reflected an independent thresholding mechanism in the distal dendrite. When strong olfactory nerve excitation was paired with strong inhibition to the mitral cell basal secondary dendrites, a small fast prepotential was recorded at the soma, which indicated that an action potential was initiated in the distal primary dendrite but failed to propagate to the soma. As the inhibition became weaker, a \"double-spike\" was often observed at the dendritic recording site, corresponding to a single action potential at the soma. Simulation demonstrated that, in the course of forward propagation of the first dendritic spike, the action potential suddenly jumps from the middle of the dendrite to the axonal spike-initiation site, leaving the proximal part of primary dendrite unexcited by this initial dendritic spike. As Na(+) conductances in the proximal dendrite are not activated, they become available to support the back-propagation of the evoked somatic action potential to produce the second dendritic spike.

Synapses adjacent to these branch points were activated twice in rapid succession, first by an impulse arriving from the periphery and then by its reflection. This fast double-firing facilitated synaptic transmission, increasing it to more than twice its normal level.

More recent experiments have shown that this large-scale synchrony depends on the integrity of corticothalamic feedback. Previously proposed mechanisms emphasized exclusively intrathalamic mechanisms to generate the synchrony of these oscillations. In the present paper, we propose a cellular mechanism in which the synchrony is dependent of a mutual interaction between cortex and thalamus. This cellular mechanism is tested by computational models consisting of pyramidal cells, interneurons, thalamic reticular (RE) and thalamocortical (TC) relay cells, on the basis of voltage-clamp data on intrinsic currents and synaptic receptors present in the circuitry. The model suggests that corticothalamic feedback must operate on the thalamus mainly through excitation of GABAergic RE neurons, therefore recruiting relay cells essentially through inhibition and rebound. We provide experimental evidence for such dominant inhibition in the lateral posterior nucleus. In these conditions, the model shows that cortical discharges optimally evoked thalamic oscillations. This feature is essential to the present cellular mechanism and is also consistently observed experimentally. The model further shows that, with this type of corticothalamic feedback, cortical discharges recruited large areas of the thalamus because of the divergent cortex-to-RE and RE-to-TC axonal projections. Consequently, the thalamocortical network generated patterns of oscillations and synchrony similar to in vivo recordings. The model also emphasizes the important role of the modulation of the Ih current by calcium in TC cells. This property conferred a relative refractoriness to the entire network, a feature also observed experimentally, as we show here. Further, the same property accounted for various spatiotemporal features of oscillations, such as systematic propagation after low-intensity cortical stimulation, local oscillations, and more generally, a high variability in the patterns of spontaneous oscillations, similar to in vivo recordings.

These channels included a fast and persistent Na+ channel, three voltage-dependent K+ channels, T-type and P-type Ca2+ channels, and two types of Ca(2+)-activated K+ channels. 2. The ionic channels were distributed differentially over three zones of the model, with Na+ channels in the soma, fast K+ channels in the soma and main dendrite, and Ca2+ channels and Ca(2+)-activated K+ channels in the entire dendrite. Channel densities in the model were varied until it could reproduce Purkinje cell responses to current injections in the soma or dendrite, as observed in slice recordings. 3. As in real Purkinje cells, the model generated two types of spiking behavior. In response to small current injections the model fired exclusively fast somatic spikes. These somatic spikes were caused by Na+ channels and repolarized by the delayed rectifier. When higher-amplitude current injections were given, sodium spiking increased in frequency until the model generated large dendritic Ca2+ spikes. Analysis of membrane currents underlying this behavior showed that these Ca2+ spikes were caused by the P-type Ca2+ channel and repolarized by the BK-type Ca(2+)-activated K+ channel. As in pharmacological blocking experiments, removal of Na+ channels abolished the fast spikes and removal of Ca2+ channels removed Ca2+ spiking. 4. In addition to spiking behavior, the model also produced slow plateau potentials in both the dendrite and soma. These longer-duration potentials occurred in response to both short and prolonged current steps. Analysis of the model demonstrated that the plateau potentials in the soma were caused by the window current component of the fast Na+ current, which was much larger than the current through the persistent Na+ channels. Plateau potentials in the dendrite were carried by the same P-type Ca2+ channel that was also responsible for Ca2+ spike generation. The P channel could participate in both model functions because of the low-threshold K2-type Ca(2+)-activated K+ channel, which dynamically changed the threshold for dendritic spike generation through a negative feedback loop with the activation kinetics of the P-type Ca2+ channel. 5.

The shape of the dendritic complex spike could be altered by changing the maximum conductance of the climbing fiber synapse and thus the amount of Ca2+ entering the cell. 3. To explore the background simple spike firing properties of Purkinje cells in vivo we added excitatory \"parallel fiber\" synapses to the spiny dendritic branches of the model. Continuous asynchronous activation of these granule cell synapses resulted in the generation of spontaneous sodium spikes. However, very low asynchronous input frequencies produced a highly regular, very fast rhythm (80-120 Hz), whereas slightly higher input frequencies resulted in Purkinje cell bursting. Both types of activity are uncharacteristic of in vivo Purkinje cell recordings. 4. Inhibitory synapses of the sort presumably generated by stellate cells were also added to the dendritic tree. When asynchronous activation of these inhibitory synapses was combined with continuous asynchronous excitatory input the model generated somatic action potentials in a much more stochastic pattern typical of real Purkinje cells. Under these conditions simulated inter-spike interval distributions resembled those found in experimental recordings. Also, as with in vivo recordings, the model did not generate dendritic bursts. This was mainly due to inhibition that suppressed the generation of dendritic Ca2+ spikes. 5. In the presence of asynchronous inhibition, changes in the average frequency of excitatory inputs modulated background simple spike firing frequencies in the natural range of Purkinje cell firing frequencies (30-100 Hz). This modulation was very sensitive to small changes in the average frequency of excitatory inputs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"}], "ArticleTitle": "An active membrane model of the cerebellar Purkinje cell II.

These ionic channels can be activated by subthreshold synaptic input, but the functional role of such activations in vivo is unclear. The interaction between dendritic channels and synaptic background input as it occurs in vivo was studied in a realistic computer model of a cerebellar Purkinje cell. It previously was shown using this model that dendritic Ca2+ channels amplify the somatic response to synchronous excitatory inputs. In this study, it is shown that dendritic ion channels also increased the somatic membrane potential fluctuations generated by the background input. This amplification caused a highly variable somatic excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) in response to a synchronous excitatory input. The variability scaled with the size of the response in the model with excitable dendrite, resulting in an almost constant coefficient of variation, whereas in a passive model the membrane potential fluctuations simply added onto the EPSP. Although the EPSP amplitude in the active dendrite model was quite variable for different patterns of background input, it was insensitive to changes in the timing of the synchronous input by a few milliseconds. This effect was explained by slow changes in dendritic excitability. This excitability was determined by how the background input affected the dendritic membrane potentials in the preceding 10-20 ms, causing changes in activation of voltage and Ca2+-gated channels. The most important model variables determining the excitability at the time of a synchronous input were the Ca2+-activation of K+ channels and the inhibitory synaptic conductance, although many other model variables could be influential for particular background patterns. Experimental evidence for the amplification of postsynaptic variability by active dendrites is discussed. The amplification of the variability of EPSPs has important functional consequences in general and for cerebellar Purkinje cells specifically. Subthreshold, background input has a much larger effect on the responses to coherent input of neurons with active dendrites compared with passive dendrites because it can change the effective threshold for firing.

The model predicts phasic release of transmitter with a time course similar to that of the endplate current--it turns on with a lag, rises rapidly to a peak, and then declines more slowly. It also predicts facilitation, the increased transmitter release in response to a second stimulus for many milliseconds after the initial transmitter release has ceased.

During these seizures, thalamic reticular (RE) neurons discharged with long spike bursts riding on a depolarization, whereas thalamocortical (TC) neurons were either entrained into the seizures (40%) or were quiescent (60%). During quiescence, TC neurons showed phasic inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) that coincided with paroxysmal depolarizing shifts in the simultaneously recorded cortical neuron. Computer simulations of a reciprocally connected TC-RE pair showed two major modes of TC-RE interaction. In one mode, a mutual oscillation involved direct TC neuron excitation of the RE neuron leading to a burst that fed back an IPSP into the TC neuron, producing a low-threshold spike. In the other, quiescent mode, the TC neuron was subject to stronger coalescing IPSPs. Simulated cortical stimulation could trigger a transition between the two modes. This transition could go in either direction and was dependent on the precise timing of the input. The transition did not always follow the stimulation immediately. A larger, multicolumnar simulation was set up to assess the role of the TC-RE pair in the context of extensive divergence and convergence. The amount of TC neuron spiking generally correlated with the strength of total inhibitory input, but large variations in the amount of spiking could be seen. Evidence for mutual oscillation could be demonstrated by comparing TC neuron firing with that in reciprocally connected RE neurons. An additional mechanism for TC neuron quiescence was assessed with the use of a cooperative model of gamma-aminobutyric acid-B (GABA(B))-mediated responses. With this model, RE neurons receiving repeated strong excitatory input produced TC neuron quiescence due to burst-duration-associated augmentation of GABA(B) current. We predict the existence of spatial inhomogeneity in apparently generalized spike-wave seizures, involving a center-surround pattern. In the center, intense cortical and RE neuron activity would be associated with TC neuron quiescence. In the surround, less intense hyperpolarization of TC neurons would allow low-threshold spikes to occur. This surround, an \"epileptic penumbra,\" would be the forefront of the expanding epileptic wave during the process of initial seizure generalization.

Transfer effectiveness of the dendrites with distributed sources was estimated by the core current increment directly related to the total membrane current per unit path length. The effectiveness decreased with increasing path distance from the soma along uniform branches. The primary reason for this was the asymmetry of somatopetal vs somatofugal input core conductance met by synaptic current due to a greater leak conductance at the proximal end of the dendrite. Under these conditions, an increasing somatopetal core current and a corresponding drop of the depolarization membrane potential occurred. The voltage-dependent extrasynaptic conductances, if present, followed this depolarization. Consequently, the driving potential and membrane current densities decreased with increasing path distance from the soma. All path profiles were perturbed at bifurcations, being identical in symmetrical branches and diverging in asymmetrical ones. These perturbations were caused by voltage gradient breaks (abrupt change in the profile slope) occurring at the branching node due to coincident inhomogeneity of the dendritic core cross-section area and its conductance. The gradient was greater on the side of the smaller effective cross-section. Correspondingly, the path profiles of the somatopetal current transfer effectiveness were broken and/or diverged.

The rhythmic activity of this network originates from two segmental oscillators located in the third and fourth midbody ganglia. In the intact nerve cord, these segmental oscillators are mutually entrained to the same cycle period. Although experiments have shown that the segmental oscillators are coupled by inhibitory coordinating interneurons, the underlying mechanisms of intersegmental coordination have not yet been elucidated. To help understand this coordination, we have created a simple computational model with two variants: symmetric and asymmetric. In the symmetric model, neurons within each segmental oscillator called oscillator interneurons, inhibit the coordinating interneurons. In contrast, in the asymmetric model only the oscillator interneurons of one segmental oscillator inhibit the coordinating interneurons. In the symmetric model, when two segmental oscillators with different inherent periods are coupled, the faster one leads in phase, and the period of the coupled system is equal to the period of the faster oscillator. This behavior arises because, during each oscillation cycle, the oscillator interneurons of the faster segmental oscillator begin to burst before those of the slower oscillator, thereby terminating spike activity in the coordinating interneurons. Thus there is a brief period of time in each cycle when the oscillator interneurons of the slower segmental oscillator are relieved of inhibition from the coordinating interneurons. This \"removal of synaptic inhibition\" allows, within certain limits, the slower segmental oscillator to be sped to the period of the faster one. Thus the symmetric model demonstrates a plausible biophysical mechanism by which one segmental oscillator can entrain the other. In general the asymmetric model, in which only one segmental oscillator has the ability to inhibit the coordinating interneurons, behaves similarly, except only one segmental oscillator can control the period of the system.

Voltage-gated K(+) currents in nucleated patches isolated from OA interneurones consisted of three major components: a fast delayed rectifier K(+) current component that was highly sensitive to external 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) and tetraethylammonium (TEA) (half-maximal inhibitory concentrations < 0.1 mM for both blockers), a slow delayed rectifier K(+) current component that was sensitive to high concentrations of TEA, but insensitive to 4-AP, and a rapidly inactivating A-type K(+) current component that was blocked by high concentrations of 4-AP, but resistant to TEA. The relative contributions of these components to the macroscopic K(+) current were estimated as 57 +/- 5, 25 +/- 6, and 19 +/- 2 %, respectively. Dendrotoxin, a selective blocker of Kv1 channels had only minimal effects on K(+) currents in nucleated patches. Coapplication of the membrane-permeant cAMP analogue 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate (cpt-cAMP) and the phosphodiesterase blocker isobutyl-methylxanthine (IBMX) resulted in a selective inhibition of the fast delayed rectifier K(+) current component.

The A current was isolated from other voltage-gated currents either pharmacologically or with suitable voltage-clamp protocols.

Synaptic plasticity was incorporated into the three-layer model by altering the magnitudes of conductance changes evoked in motor neurons and interneurons by presynaptic sensory neurons. In these simulations the excitatory interneurons converted an amplitude-coded input into an amplitude- and duration-coded output, allowing the three-layer network to support a large range of output amplitudes and durations. 4.

In each model periodic bursting gives way to repetitive soma spiking as somatic injected current increases. Steady dendritic stimulation can produce periodic bursting of significantly higher frequency (8-20 Hz) than can steady somatic input (< 8 Hz). Bursting in our model occurs only for an intermediate range of electronic coupling conductance. It depends on the segregation of channel types and on the coupling current that flows back-and-forth between compartments. When the soma and dendrite are tightly coupled electrically, our model reduces to a single compartment and does not burst. Network simulations with our model using excitatory AMPA and NMDA synapses (without inhibition) give results similar to those obtained with the complex cable model [Traub et al, 1991; Traub et al, 1992]. Brief stimulation of a single cell in a resting network produces multiple synchronized population bursts, with fast AMPA synapses providing the dominant synchronizing mechanism. The number of bursts increases with the level of maximal NMDA conductance. For high enough maximal NMDA conductance synchronized bursting repeats indefinitely. We find that two factors can cause the cells to desynchronize when AMPA synapses are blocked: heterogeneity of properties amongst cells and intrinsically chaotic burst dynamics. But even when cells are identical, they may synchronize only approximately rather than exactly.

Performance based on AN discharge times (all-information) is compared to performance based only on discharge counts (rate-place). After the method is verified over the range of parameters for which previous analytical models are applicable, the parameter space is then extended. For example, a computational model of AN activity that extends to high frequencies is used to explore the common belief that rate-place information is responsible for frequency encoding at high frequencies due to the rolloff in AN phase locking above 2 kHz. This rolloff is thought to eliminate temporal information at high frequencies. Contrary to this belief, results of this analysis show that rate-place predictions for frequency discrimination are inconsistent with human performance in the dependence on frequency for high frequencies and that there is significant temporal information in the AN up to at least 10 kHz. In fact, the all-information predictions match the functional dependence of human performance on frequency, although optimal performance is much better than human performance.

The delay in IP3 increase caused by the PF metabotropic pathway generated the optimal PF-CF interval. The Ca2+ dynamics revealed a threshold for large Ca2+ release that decreased as IP3 increased, and it coherently explained the different forms of LTD. At 2.5 microM IP3, CF activation after PF activation was essential to reach the threshold for the regenerative Ca2+ release.

The kinetics of Mg(2+) unblock were found to be non-instantaneous and complex, consisting of a prominent fast component (time constant approximately 100 micros) and slower components (time constants 4 and approximately 300 ms), the relative amplitudes of which depended on the timing of the depolarizing pulse. Fitting a kinetic model to these data indicated that Mg(2+) not only blocks the NMDAR channel, but reduces both the open probability and affinity for glutamate, while enhancing desensitization. These effects slow the rate of NMDAR channel opening in response to depolarization in a time-dependent manner such that the slower components of Mg(2+) unblock are enhanced during depolarizations at later times after glutamate application. One physiological consequence of this is that brief depolarizations occurring earlier in time after glutamate application are better able to open NMDAR channels.

We computed the steady-state activity of a large-scale model of the granular layer of the rat cerebellum. Within a few tens of milliseconds after the start of random mossy fiber input, the populations of Golgi and granule cells became entrained in a single synchronous oscillation, the basic frequency of which ranged from 10 to 40 Hz depending on the average rate of firing in the mossy fiber population. The long parallel fibers ensured, through alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid-mediated synapses, a coherent excitation of Golgi cells, while the regular firing of each Golgi cell synchronized all granule cells within its axonal radius through transient activation of their gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABAA) receptor synapses. Individual granule cells often remained silent during a few successive oscillation cycles so that their average firing rates, which could be quite variable, reflected the average activities of their mossy fiber afferents. The synchronous, rhythmic firing pattern was robust over a broad range of biologically realistic parameter values and to parameter randomization. Three conditions, however, made the oscillations more transient and could desynchronize the entire network in the end: a very low mossy fiber activity, a very dominant excitation of Golgi cells through mossy fiber synapses (rather than through parallel fiber synapses), and a tonic activation of granule cell GABAA receptors (with an almost complete absence of synaptically induced inhibitory postsynaptic currents). These three conditions were associated with a reduction in the parallel fiber activity, and synchrony could be restored by increasing the mossy fiber firing rate. The model predicts that, under conditions of strong mossy fiber input to the cerebellum, Golgi cells do not only control the strength of parallel fiber activity but also the timing of the individual spikes.

These events are initiated in layer V and are synchronous with polyphasic long-duration excitatory and inhibitory potentials (currents) in neurons that may last several hundred milliseconds. Stimuli that are significantly above threshold for triggering these epileptiform events evoke only a single large excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) followed by an inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP).

In control simulations, this activity was prevented by the rapid development of IPSPs. One manipulation that could give rise to epileptogenesis was an increase in the threshold of inhibitory interneurons. However, previous experimental data from layer V pyramidal neurons of these chronic epileptogenic lesions indicate: upregulation, rather than downregulation, of inhibition; alterations in the intrinsic properties of pyramidal cells that would tend to make them more excitable; and sprouting of their intracortical axons and increased numbers of presumed synaptic contacts, which would increase recurrent EPSPs from one cell onto another.

This suggests that hair cell activity is acting via some other pathway to initiate memory storage. In addition, simulations show that a potassium leak channel, which closes with an increase in calcium, is required to produce both the untrained LLD and the enhanced LLD due to the decrease in voltage dependent potassium currents.

Simulations using NEURON software demonstrated that I(Na,P) was necessary and sufficient to explain amplification, whereas I(Na,P) and I(Ca,P) acted synergistically to prolong depolarization: initial activation of the slower current (I(Ca,P)) depended on the faster current (I(Na,P)) but maintained activation of the faster current likewise depended on the slower current. Additional investigation revealed that I(Na,P) and I(Ca,P) could dramatically increase integration time (>30x) and thereby encourage temporal summation but at the expense of spike time precision.

A model of the transient, low-threshold voltage-dependent (T-type) Ca2+ current is constructed using recent whole-cell voltage-clamp data from enzymatically isolated rat thalamocortical relay neurons. The T-type Ca2+ current is described according to the Hodgkin-Huxley scheme, using the m3h format, with rate constants determined from the experimental data (22-24 degrees C; extracellular Ca2+ concentration [Ca2+]o = 3 mM). 2. The T-type Ca2+ current inactivates rapidly during maintained depolarization (time constant, Tau h approximately 20 ms at -20 mV), yet recovery from inactivation is slow (time constant, Tau r approximately 270 ms at -80 mV). To reconcile these observations, a two-step kinetic scheme is proposed for the inactivation gate. Each of the time constants in this scheme is voltage dependent, with a maximum at about -85 mV (45 ms for one and 275 ms for the other). 3. Numerical simulations of recovery in a two-pulse, voltage-clamp protocol compare favorably with experimental results obtained by Coulter et al. as well as those obtained in an independent series of experiments with guinea pig thalamic neurons ([Ca2+]o = 10 mM). 4. For current-clamp simulations, a leakage current gL (V-VL) is included; with VL = -65 mV, the calculated resting membrane potential is -63 mV. 5. It is shown that the T-type Ca2+ current together with the leakage current suffices to describe the low-threshold spike (LTS), a slow, triangular-shaped depolarizing event that can be evoked only from relatively hyperpolarized membrane potentials and that underlies the burst firing of Na(+)-dependent action potentials in thalamic neurons. Outward currents are not required to reproduce the basic shape of the LTS. 6. The LTS can be activated with either a depolarizing current step from a sufficiently hyperpolarized level or on termination of a hyperpolarizing current step. In either case, the amplitude of the LTS is a monotonically increasing, sigmoid-shape function of the hyperpolarizing current step intensity. 7. Because of the slower kinetic step of the channel's inactivation gate, our model predicts that recovery of the LTS to greater than one-half amplitude would require a prolonged hyperpolarization of greater than 100 ms (at body temperature).

The majority of the numerical methods of parameter estimation makes use of one or another type of non-linear optimization algorithms, and hence is, by nature, iterative.

Our results show that IKs is the major outward current during the plateau repolarization. A specific block of either IKr or IKs can effectively prolong APD to the same degree. Therefore, either channel provides a target for class III antiarrhythmic drugs. In the simulated guinea pig ventricular cell, complete block of IKr does not result in early afterdepolarizations (EADs). In contrast, > 80% block of IKs results in abnormal repolarization and EADs. This behavior reflects the high IKs-to-IKr density ratio (approximately 8:1) in this cell and can be reversed (ie, IKr block can cause EADs) by reducing the ratio of IKs to IKr. The computed APD restitution curve is consistent with the experimental behavior, displaying fast APD variation at short diastolic intervals (DIs) and downward shift at longer DIs with the decrease of basic drive cycle length (BCL). Examining the ionic currents and their underlying kinetic processes, we found that activation of both IKr and IKs is the primary determinant of the APD restitution at shorter DIs, with Ca2+ current through L-type channels (ICa) playing a minor role. The rate of APD change depends on the relative densities of IKr and IKs; it increases when the IKr-to-IKs density ratio is large. The BCL-dependent shift of restitution at longer DIs is primarily attributed to long-lasting changes in [Ca2+]i. This in turn causes different degrees of Ca(2+)-dependent inactivation of ICa and different degrees of Ca(2+)-dependent conductance of IKs at very long DIs (> 5 s) for different BCLs.

Synchronized bursts appear for intermediate values of the NMDA conductance g(NMDA) if NMDA conductances are not too fast. Regular spiking activity appears for larger g(NMDA). If the single cell is a conditional burster, persistent synchronized bursts become more robust. Weakly synchronized states appear for zero AMPA conductance g(AMPA). Enhancing g(AMPA) increases both synchrony and the number of spikes within bursts and decreases the bursting frequency. Too strong g(AMPA), however, prevents the activity because it enhances neuronal intrinsic adaptation. When [Mg2+]o is increased, higher g(NMDA) values are needed to maintain bursting activity. Bursting frequency decreases with [Mg2+]o, and the network is silent with physiological [Mg2+]o. Inhibition weakly decreases the bursting frequency if inhibitory cells receive enough NMDA-mediated excitation.

In response to a voltage step, I(K) activates with an exponential time course, following a brief delay. The delay suggests that rapid transitions precede channel opening. The later exponential time course suggests that activation also involves a slower rate-limiting step. However, the time constant of I(K) relaxation [tau(I(K))] exhibits a complex voltage dependence that is inconsistent with models that contain a single rate limiting step. tau(I(K)) increases weakly with voltage from -500 to -20 mV, with an equivalent charge (z) of only 0.14 e, and displays a stronger voltage dependence from +30 to +140 mV (z = 0.49 e), which then decreases from +180 to +240 mV (z = -0.29 e).

We consider the hypothesis that two factors are essential for latency coding in the POm. The first is GABAB-mediated feedback inhibition from the reticular thalamic (Rt) nucleus, which provides delayed and prolonged input to thalamic structures. The second is sensory input that leads to an accelerating spike rate in brain stem nuclei. Essential aspects of the experimental observations are replicated by the analytical solution of a rate-based model with a minimal architecture that includes only the POm and Rt nuclei, i.e., an increase in stimulus frequency will increase the level of inhibitory output from Rt thalamus and lead to a longer latency in the activation of POm thalamus. This architecture, however, admits period-doubling at high levels of GABAB-mediated conductance. A full architecture that incorporates the VPm nucleus suppresses period-doubling. A clear match between the experimentally measured spike rates and the numerically calculated rates for the full model occurs when VPm thalamus receives stronger brain stem input and weaker GABAB-mediated inhibition than POm thalamus.

In fact, the relative effectiveness of proximally distributed inhibitory inputs over uniformly distributed synapses was greater in suprathreshold conditions than that in subthreshold conditions. The somatic voltage clamp minimized saturation of inhibitory driving potentials.

We performed high temporal resolution studies of sodium currents gating in three types of central neurons. The results show that, within the tested voltage range from -55 to -35 mV, in all of these neurons, the activation time course of the current could be fit, after a brief delay, with a monoexponential function.

Despite previous reports describing action-potential propagation in the proximal apical dendrites, the extent to which action potentials invade the distal dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons remains controversial. Using paired somatic and dendritic whole cell recordings, we find that in the dendrites proximal to 280 microm from the soma, single backpropagating action potentials exhibit <50% attenuation from their amplitude in the soma. However, in dendritic recordings distal to 300 microm from the soma, action potentials in most cells backpropagated either strongly (26-42% attenuation; n = 9/20) or weakly (71-87% attenuation; n = 10/20) with only one cell exhibiting an intermediate value (45% attenuation). In experiments combining dual somatic and dendritic whole cell recordings with calcium imaging, the amount of calcium influx triggered by backpropagating action potentials was correlated with the extent of action-potential invasion of the distal dendrites. Quantitative morphometric analyses revealed that the dichotomy in action-potential backpropagation occurred in the presence of only subtle differences in either the diameter of the primary apical dendrite or branching pattern. In addition, action-potential backpropagation was not dependent on a number of electrophysiological parameters (input resistance, resting potential, voltage sensitivity of dendritic spike amplitude). There was, however, a striking correlation of the shape of the action potential at the soma with its amplitude in the dendrite; larger, faster-rising, and narrower somatic action potentials exhibited more attenuation in the distal dendrites (300-410 microm from the soma). Simple compartmental models of CA1 pyramidal neurons revealed that a dichotomy in action-potential backpropagation could be generated in response to subtle manipulations of the distribution of either sodium or potassium channels in the dendrites. Backpropagation efficacy could also be influenced by local alterations in dendritic side branches, but these effects were highly sensitive to model parameters.

We suggest a simple solution that corrects these deviations, leading to extended analytic expressions of the Vm distribution valid for a parameter regime that covers several orders of magnitude around physiologically realistic values.

The goal was to find conductance changes that could produce a greater than 3 mV hyperpolarization of Vth with only small changes in AP height (< 3 mV) and width (< 1.2 ms). Vth reduction without large changes in AP shape could be produced either by increasing fast sodium current or by reducing delayed rectifier potassium current. The most effective Vth reductions were achieved by either increasing the conductance of fast sodium channels or by hyperpolarizing the voltage dependency of their activation.

In fibres made mechanically inactive with hypertonic solutions (Ringer solution plus 350 mM sucrose) step depolarizations produced ionic currents which resembled those of nerve in showing (a) an early transient inward current, abolished by tetrodotoxin, which reversed when the depolarization was carried beyond an internal potential of about +20 mV, (b) a delayed outward current, with a linear instantaneous current-voltage relation, and a mean equilibrium potential with a normal potassium concentration (2.5 mM) of -85 mV.4. The reversal potential for the early current appears to be consistent with the sodium equilibrium potential expected in hypertonic solutions.5. The variation of the equilibrium potential for the delayed current (V'(K)) with external potassium concentration suggests that the channel for delayed current has a ratio of potassium to sodium permeability of 30:1; this is less than the resting membrane where the ratio appears to be 100:1. V'(K) corresponds well with the membrane potential at the beginning of the negative after-potential observed under similar conditions.6. The variation of V'(K) with the amount of current which has passed through the delayed channel suggests that potassium ions accumulate in a space of between (1/3) and (1/6) of the fibre volume. If potassium accumulates in the transverse tubular system (T system) much greater variation in V'(K) would be expected.7. The delayed current is not maintained but is inactivated like the early current. The inactivation is approximately exponential with a time constant of 0.5 to 1 sec at 20 degrees C. The steady-state inactivation of the potassium current is similar to that for the sodium current, but its voltage dependence is less steep and the potential for half inactivation is 20 mV rate more positive.8.

During working-memory tasks, PFC neurons exhibit sustained elevated activity, which may reflect the active holding of goal-related information or the preparation of forthcoming actions. Dopamine via the D1 receptor strongly modulates both this sustained (delay-period) activity and behavioral performance in working-memory tasks. However, the function of dopamine during delay-period activity and the underlying neural mechanisms are only poorly understood. Recently we proposed that dopamine might stabilize active neural representations in PFC circuits during tasks involving working memory and render them robust against interfering stimuli and noise. To further test this idea and to examine the dopamine-modulated ionic currents that could give rise to increased stability of neural representations, we developed a network model of the PFC consisting of multicompartment neurons equipped with Hodgkin-Huxley-like channel kinetics that could reproduce in vitro whole cell and in vivo recordings from PFC neurons. Dopaminergic effects on intrinsic ionic and synaptic conductances were implemented in the model based on in vitro data. Simulated dopamine strongly enhanced high, delay-type activity but not low, spontaneous activity in the model network. Furthermore the strength of an afferent stimulation needed to disrupt delay-type activity increased with the magnitude of the dopamine-induced shifts in network parameters, making the currently active representation much more stable. Stability could be increased by dopamine-induced enhancements of the persistent Na(+) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) conductances. Stability also was enhanced by a reduction in AMPA conductances. The increase in GABA(A) conductances that occurs after stimulation of dopaminergic D1 receptors was necessary in this context to prevent uncontrolled, spontaneous switches into high-activity states (i.e., spontaneous activation of task-irrelevant representations). In conclusion, the dopamine-induced changes in the biophysical properties of intrinsic ionic and synaptic conductances conjointly acted to highly increase stability of activated representations in PFC networks and at the same time retain control over network behavior and thus preserve its ability to adequately respond to task-related stimuli.

The probability of spike occurrence in neurones is determined by the time course and magnitude of the total current reaching the spike initiation zone. The features of this current that are most effective in evoking spikes can be determined by injecting a Gaussian current waveform into a neurone and using spike-triggered reverse correlation to calculate the average current trajectory (ACT) preceding spikes. The time course of this ACT (and the related first-order Wiener kernel) provides a general description of a neurone's response to dynamic stimuli. In many different neurones, the ACT is characterized by a shallow hyperpolarizing trough followed by a more rapid depolarizing peak immediately preceding the spike. The hyperpolarizing phase is thought to reflect an enhancement of excitability by partial removal of sodium inactivation. Alternatively, this feature could simply reflect the fact that interspike intervals that are longer than average can only occur when the current is lower than average toward the end of the interspike interval. Thus, the ACT calculated for the entire spike train displays an attenuated version of the hyperpolarizing trough associated with the long interspike intervals. This alternative explanation for the characteristic shape of the ACT implies that it depends upon the time since the previous spike, i.e. the ACT reflects both previous stimulus history and previous discharge history. The present study presents results based on recordings of noise-driven discharge in rat hypoglossal motoneurones that support this alternative explanation. First, we show that the hyperpolarizing trough is larger in ACTs calculated from spikes preceded by long interspike intervals, and minimal or absent in those based on short interspike intervals. Second, we show that the trough is present for ACTs calculated from the discharge of a threshold-crossing neurone model with a postspike afterhyperpolarization (AHP), but absent from those calculated from the discharge of a model without an AHP. We show that it is possible to represent noise-driven discharge using a two-component linear model that predicts discharge probability based on the sum of a feedback kernel and a stimulus kernel. The feedback kernel reflects the influence of prior discharge mediated by the AHP, and it increases in amplitude when AHP amplitude is increased by pharmacological manipulations. Finally, we show that the predictions of this model are virtually identical to those based on the first-order Wiener kernel.

When the synaptic input came sequentially, each individual input was still discernible at depolarized levels at which the membrane time constant was short due to depolarization-dependent membrane conductances. In contrast, synaptic potentials merged with each other to develop a sustained potential at hyperpolarized levels where the membrane behaved passively. Thus, synaptic integration in a single nonspiking interneuron depends on the value of membrane potential at which it occurs. This probably reflects the temporal resolution required for specific types of information processing."}], "ArticleTitle": "Information processing by nonspiking interneurons: passive and active properties of dendritic membrane determine synaptic integration."}}, "84606": {"17255467": {"mesh": ["Action Potentials", "Anticonvulsants", "Calcium", "Calcium Channels, L-Type", "Cell Differentiation", "Cell Line", "Electrophysiology", "Hippocampus", "Humans", "Isoxazoles", "Kinetics", "Large-Conductance Calcium-Activated Potassium Channels", "Models, Statistical", "Neurons", "Patch-Clamp Techniques", "Pyramidal Cells", "Zonisamide"], "AbstractText": [{"section": null, "text": "Zonisamide (ZNS; 3-sulfamoylmethyl-1,2-benzisoxazole), as one of the newer antiepileptic drugs, has been demonstrated its broad-spectrum clinical efficacy on various neuropsychiatric disorders.

We hypothesize that most bursts are triggered by a barrage of synaptic input and that particularly meaningful stimuli recruit larger numbers of synapses in a more synchronous way. An example of concurrent modulation is that increasing the short-lived AMPA current evokes additional spikes without regard to pattern, producing comparable increases in spike frequency and fraction fired in bursts. On the other hand, blocking the SK current evokes additional bursts by allowing a depolarization that previously produced only a single spike to elicit two or more and elongates existing bursts by the same principle, resulting in a greater effect on pattern than rate. A probabilistic algorithm for the random insertion of spikes into the firing pattern produces a good approximation to the pattern changes induced by increasing the AMPA conductance, but not by blocking the SK current, consistent with a differential modulation in the latter case.

This synaptic plasticity is produced by phosphorylation of AMPA receptors, caused by phosphorylation of various signalling molecules. A key signalling molecule is the phosphoprotein DARPP-32, highly expressed in striatal medium spiny neurons. DARPP-32 is regulated by several neurotransmitters through a complex network of intracellular signalling pathways involving cAMP (increased through dopamine stimulation) and calcium (increased through glutamate stimulation). Since DARPP-32 controls several kinases and phosphatases involved in striatal synaptic plasticity, understanding the interactions between cAMP and calcium, in particular the effect of transient stimuli on DARPP-32 phosphorylation, has major implications for understanding reinforcement learning. We developed a computer model of the biochemical reaction pathways involved in the phosphorylation of DARPP-32 on Thr34 and Thr75. Ordinary differential equations describing the biochemical reactions were implemented in a single compartment model using the software XPPAUT.

In the present paper, we hypothesize that it emerges naturally if one assumes a continuous distribution of properties in a small set of active channels. To test this hypothesis, we construct a minimal, single-compartment conductance-based model of FS cells that includes transient Na(+), delayed-rectifier K(+), and slowly inactivating d-type K(+) conductances. The model is analyzed using nonlinear dynamical system theory. For small Na(+) window current, the neuron exhibits high-frequency tonic firing. At current threshold, the spike response is almost instantaneous for small d-current conductance, gd, and it is delayed for larger gd. As gd further increases, the neuron stutters. Noise substantially reduces the delay duration and induces subthreshold oscillations. In contrast, when the Na(+) window current is large, the neuron always fires tonically. Near threshold, the firing rates are low, and the delay to firing is only weakly sensitive to noise; subthreshold oscillations are not observed. We propose that the variability in the response of cortical FS neurons is a consequence of heterogeneities in their gd and in the strength of their Na(+) window current.

Besides experimental methods carried out either in vitro (human or animal tissue) or in vivo (animals), pathophysiologic mechanisms can be approached by direct recording of brain electrical activity in human epilepsy. Indeed, in some clinical presurgical investigation methods like stereoelectroencephalography, intracerebral electrodes are used in patients suffering from drug resistant epilepsy to directly record paroxysmal activities with excellent temporal resolution (in the order of 1 millisecond). The study of neurophysiologic mechanisms underlying such depth-EEG activities is crucial to progress in the understanding of the interictal to ictal transition. In this study, the authors relate electrophysiologic patterns typically observed during the transition from interictal to ictal activity in human mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) to mechanisms (at a neuronal population level) involved in seizure generation through a computational model of EEG activity. Intracerebral EEG signals recorded from hippocampus in five patients with MTLE during four periods (during interictal activity, just before seizure onset, during seizure onset, and during ictal activity) were used to identify the three main parameters of a model of hippocampus EEG activity (related to excitation, slow dendritic inhibition and fast somatic inhibition). The identification procedure used optimization algorithms to minimize a spectral distance between real and simulated signals. Results demonstrated that the model generates very realistic signals for automatically identified parameters. They also showed that the transition from interictal to ictal activity cannot be simply explained by an increase in excitation and a decrease in inhibition but rather by time-varying ensemble interactions between pyramidal cells and local interneurons projecting to either their dendritic or perisomatic region (with slow and fast GABAA kinetics).

Additionally, Ca(2+) binding to the C-terminal lobe triggers regulation that appears preferentially responsive to local Ca(2+) influx through the channel to which CaM is attached (local Ca(2+) preference), whereas Ca(2+) binding to the N-terminal lobe triggers modulation that favors activation via Ca(2+) entry through channels at a distance (global Ca(2+) preference). Ca(V)2.1 channels fully exemplify these features; Ca(2+) binding to the C-terminal lobe induces Ca(2+)-dependent facilitation of opening (CDF), whereas the N-terminal lobe yields Ca(2+)-dependent inactivation of opening (CDI). In mitigation of these interesting indications, support for this local/global Ca(2+) selectivity has been based upon indirect inferences from macroscopic recordings of numerous channels. Nagging uncertainty has also remained as to whether CDF represents a relief of basal inhibition of channel open probability (P(o)) in the presence of external Ca(2+), or an actual enhancement of P(o) over a normal baseline seen with Ba(2+) as the charge carrier. To address these issues, we undertake the first extensive single-channel analysis of Ca(V)2.1 channels with Ca(2+) as charge carrier. A key outcome is that CDF persists at this level, while CDI is entirely lacking.

Furthermore, direct single-channel determinations of P(o) and kinetic simulations demonstrate that CDF represents a genuine enhancement of open probability, without appreciable change of activation kinetics.

Experiments on these simulations demonstrated the presence of epileptiform behavior in the form of repetitive high-intensity population events (clonic behavior) or latch-up with near maximal activity (tonic behavior).

A local HSP mechanism, operating at the level of the individual synapse, will regard the neuron as a multiunit distributed system, each unit consisting of many synapses, and will thus support dendritic compartmentalization, whereas a global HSP mechanism, modifying all synapses in unison, will treat the neuron as a single centralized unit. Both local and global HSP can successfully counterbalance persistent, cell-wide perturbations of dendritic activity. The spatial distribution of synaptic weights throughout the dendrites will markedly differ under the local versus global HSP mechanisms.

However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood, and the impact of morphology on burst firing remains insufficiently known. Dendritic morphology is not fixed but can undergo significant changes in many pathological conditions. Using computational models of neocortical pyramidal cells, we here show that not only the total length of the apical dendrite but also the topological structure of its branching pattern markedly influences inter- and intraburst spike intervals and even determines whether or not a cell exhibits burst firing. We found that there is only a range of dendritic sizes that supports burst firing, and that this range is modulated by dendritic topology. Either reducing or enlarging the dendritic tree, or merely modifying its topological structure without changing total dendritic length, can transform a cell's firing pattern from bursting to tonic firing. Interestingly, the results are largely independent of whether the cells are stimulated by current injection at the soma or by synapses distributed over the dendritic tree. By means of a novel measure called mean electrotonic path length, we show that the influence of dendritic morphology on burst firing is attributable to the effect both dendritic size and dendritic topology have, not on somatic input conductance, but on the average spatial extent of the dendritic tree and the spatiotemporal dynamics of the dendritic membrane potential.

We present a detailed biochemical model of the CaMKII autophosphorylation and the protein signaling cascade governing the CaMKII dephosphorylation.

We show here that increased CaMKII dephosphorylation activity at intermediate Ca(2+) concentrations can lead to switching from the UP to the DOWN state (similar to a LTD event).

We recorded from spinal sensory neurons representing each class and reproduced their transduction properties in a minimal model.

Class 1 excitability occurs through a saddle node on invariant circle bifurcation when net current at perithreshold potentials is inward (depolarizing) at steady state. Class 2 excitability occurs through a Hopf bifurcation when, despite net current being outward (hyperpolarizing) at steady state, spike initiation occurs because inward current activates faster than outward current.

This article provides tools for an analytic treatment of reward-modulated STDP, which allows us to predict under which conditions reward-modulated STDP will achieve a desired learning effect. These analytical results imply that neurons can learn through reward-modulated STDP to classify not only spatial but also temporal firing patterns of presynaptic neurons. They also can learn to respond to specific presynaptic firing patterns with particular spike patterns. Finally, the resulting learning theory predicts that even difficult credit-assignment problems, where it is very hard to tell which synaptic weights should be modified in order to increase the global reward for the system, can be solved in a self-organizing manner through reward-modulated STDP. This yields an explanation for a fundamental experimental result on biofeedback in monkeys by Fetz and Baker.

Consistent and robust burst firing was observed in all interneurons when a slight depolarizing boost was given from a potential at, or slightly hyperpolarized from, resting membrane potential. These bursts had some similarities to the low-threshold spike described previously in other thalamic neuron types. The bursting responses were blocked by Ni+, suggesting that the low-threshold calcium current I(T), responsible for the low-threshold spike, was also involved in interneuron burst firing. Compared to the low-threshold spike of thalamocortical cells, however, the interneuron bursts were of relatively long duration and low intraburst frequency. The requirement for a depolarizing boost to elicit the burst is consistent with previous reports of a depolarizing shift of the I(T) activation curve of interneurons relative to thalamocortical cells, a finding we confirmed using voltage-clamp. Voltage-clamp study also revealed an additional long-lasting current that could be tentatively identified as the calcium activated non-selective cation current, I(CAN), based on reversal potential and on pharmacological characteristics. Computer simulation of the interneuron burst demonstrated that its particular morphology is likely due to the interaction of I(T) and I(CAN). In the slice, bursts could also be elicited by stimulation of the optic tract, suggesting that they may occur in response to natural stimulation. Synaptically triggered bursts were only partially blocked by Ni+, but could then be completely blocked by further addition of (+/-)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid.

In our simulations of parkinsonian conditions, rhythmic inhibition from GPi to the thalamus compromises the ability of thalamocortical relay (TC) cells to respond to depolarizing inputs, such as sensorimotor signals. High frequency stimulation of STN regularizes GPi firing, and this restores TC responsiveness, despite the increased frequency and amplitude of GPi inhibition to thalamus that result.

The model achieves direction selectivity with an elementary Reichardt motion detector: information from spatially separated receptive fields converges onto a neuron via dynamically different pathways. In the model, these differences arise from convergence of information through distinct synapses that either exhibit or do not exhibit short-term synaptic depression--short-term depression produces phase-advances relative to nondepressing synapses. Short-term depression is modeled using two state-variables, a fast process with a time constant on the order of tens to hundreds of milliseconds, and a slow process with a time constant on the order of seconds to tens of seconds. These processes correspond to naturally occurring time constants observed at synapses that exhibit short-term depression. Inclusion of the fast process is sufficient for the generation of temporal disparities that are necessary for direction selectivity in the elementary Reichardt circuit. The addition of the slow process can enhance direction selectivity over time for stimuli that are sustained for periods of seconds or more. Transient (i.e., short-duration) stimuli do not evoke the slow process and therefore do not elicit enhanced direction selectivity. The addition of a sustained global, synchronous oscillation in the gamma frequency range can, however, drive the slow process and enhance direction selectivity to transient stimuli. This enhancement effect does not, however, occur for all combinations of model parameters. The ratio of depressing and nondepressing synapses determines the effects of the addition of the global synchronous oscillation on direction selectivity.

Meanwhile, recent studies revealed that each dendritic branch of pyramidal cell functions as a compartmentalized integration subunit through local spike generation and branch-specific excitation-inhibition interaction. I have examined how such nonlinear dendritic integration, combined with the nonuniform distribution of the external input, affects the behavior of the whole circuit by constructing a rate-coding model incorporating multiple dendritic branches of the individual pyramidal cell. Simulations varying the nature of dendritic nonlinearity and the configuration of somatically and dendritically mediated recurrent inhibition revealed that dendritic compartmentalization potentially enables the circuit to form an accurate memory depending on the contrast of the external input, but insensitively to its intensity, under certain conditions; in particular, when there exists tuned global dendritic recurrent inhibition or local dendritic inhibition coupled with global somatic inhibition. The model suggests that, when the circuit receives low-contrast or background input, only a small portion of dendritic branches of each pyramidal cell can overcome the local threshold so as to contribute to the somatic low-frequency firing, which in turn stabilizes the low-activity state of the circuit by recruiting recurrent inhibition."}], "ArticleTitle": "Possible role of dendritic compartmentalization in the spatial working memory circuit."}}, "117207": {"19118105": {"mesh": ["4-Aminopyridine", "Action Potentials", "Animals", "Animals, Newborn", "Biophysical Phenomena", "Calcium", "Dendrites", "Electric Conductivity", "Electric Stimulation", "In Vitro Techniques", "Ion Channel Gating", "Models, Neurological", "Neurons", "Patch-Clamp Techniques", "Potassium Channel Blockers", "Prefrontal Cortex", "Rats", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Sodium Channel Blockers", "Styrenes", "Tetrodotoxin"], "AbstractText": [{"section": null, "text": "Basal dendrites of prefrontal cortical neurons receive strong synaptic drive from recurrent excitatory synaptic inputs.

Here we examine the loss of synchrony caused by an increase in inhibitory coupling in networks of type-I Morris-Lecar model oscillators, which is characterized by a period-doubling cascade and leads to mode-locked states with alternation in the firing order of the two cells, as reported recently by Maran and Canavier (J Comput Nerosci, 2008) for a network of Wang-Buzs&#225;ki model neurons.

Further, we examine the generality of this phenomenon for a class of type-I oscillators that are close to their excitation thresholds, and provide an intuitive geometric description of such \"leap-frog\" dynamics. In the Morris-Lecar model network, the alternation in the firing order arises under the condition of fast closing of K( + ) channels at hyperpolarized potentials, which leads to slow dynamics of membrane potential upon synaptic inhibition, allowing the presynaptic cell to advance past the postsynaptic cell in each cycle of the oscillation. Further, we show that non-zero synaptic decay time is crucial for the existence of leap-frog firing in networks of phase oscillators.

A characteristic feature of BSM in both cases is that SF magnitude depends nonmonotonically on the buffer concentration. In agreement with results of Blatow et al.

In contrast, for synapses that are less sensitive to calcium or have higher recovery rate, resonance frequency becomes higher and thus facilitation prevails. The notion of resonance frequency therefore allows valuable quantitative parametric assessment of the contributions of various presynaptic mechanisms to the directionality of synaptic short-term plasticity.

Fast in vitro chemical kinetics and in vivo electrophysiological recordings are consistent with the following multi-step scheme. Upon binding of agonists, receptor molecules in the closed but activatable resting state (the Basal state, B) undergo rapid transitions to states of higher affinities with either open channels (the Active state, A) or closed channels (the initial Inactivatable and fully Desensitized states, I and D). In order to represent the functional properties of such receptors, we have developed a kinetic model that links conformational interconversion rates to agonist binding and extends the general principles of the Monod-Wyman-Changeux model of allosteric transitions. The crucial assumption is that the linkage is controlled by the position of the interconversion transition states on a hypothetical linear reaction coordinate. Application of the model to the peripheral nicotine acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) accounts for the main properties of ligand-gating, including single-channel events, and several new relationships are predicted. Kinetic simulations reveal errors inherent in using the dose-response analysis, but justify its application under defined conditions. The model predicts that (in order to overcome the intrinsic stability of the B state and to produce the appropriate cooperativity) channel activation is driven by an A state with a Kd in the 50 nM range, hence some 140-fold stronger than the apparent affinity of the open state deduced previously. According to the model, recovery from the desensitized states may occur via rapid transit through the A state with minimal channel opening, thus without necessarily undergoing a distinct recovery pathway, as assumed in the standard 'cycle' model. Transitions to the desensitized states by low concentration 'pre-pulses' are predicted to occur without significant channel opening, but equilibrium values of IC50 can be obtained only with long pre-pulse times. Predictions are also made concerning allosteric effectors and their possible role in coincidence detection.

Second, in what manner can such variability in functional properties impact the discharge characteristics of these neurons? Here, we recorded the whole cell Na+ currents in acutely dissociated rat nodose sensory neurons using the patch-clamp technique. Two general populations of neurons were observed. A-type neurons (n = 20) expressed a single rapidly inactivating tetrodotoxin-sensitive (TTX-S) Na+ current. C-type neurons (n = 87) coexpressed this TTX-S current along with a slowly inactivating TTX-resistant (TTX-R) Na+ current. The TTX-S currents in both cell types had submillisecond rates of activation at room temperature with thresholds near -50 mV. The TTX-R current exhibited about the same rates of activation but required potentials 20-30 mV more depolarized to reach threshold. Over the same clamp voltages the rates of inactivation for the TTX-R current were three to nine times slower than those for the TTX-S current. However, the TTX-R current recovered from complete inactivation at a rate 10-20 times faster than the TTX-S current (10 ms as compared with 100-200 ms). Across the population of neurons studied the TTX-S data formed a relatively tight statistical distribution, exhibiting low standard deviations across all measured voltage- and time-dependent properties. In contrast, the same pooled measurements on the TTX-R data exhibited standard deviations that were 3-10 times larger. The statistical profiles of the voltage- and time-dependent properties of these currents then were used as a physiological guide to adjust the relevant parameters of a mathematical model of nodose sensory neurons previously developed by our group (). Here, we show how the relative expression of TTX-S and TTX-R Na+ currents and the differences in their apparent biological variability can shape the regenerative discharge characteristics and action potential waveshapes of sensory neurons.

There is now a substantial body of experimental and modeling literature supporting this hypothesis. A series of modeling papers, starting with work by Roger Traub and collaborators, have suggested that VFOs may arise from expanding waves propagating through an \"axonal plexus\", a large random network of electrically coupled axons. Traub et al. also proposed a cellular automaton (CA) model to study the mechanisms of VFOs in the axonal plexus. In this model, the expanding waves take the appearance of topologically circular \"target patterns\". Random external stimuli initiate each wave. We therefore call this kind of VFO \"externally driven\". Using a computational model, we show that an axonal plexus can also exhibit a second, distinctly different kind of VFO in a wide parameter range. These VFOs arise from activity propagating around cycles in the network. Once triggered, they persist without any source of excitation. With idealized, regular connectivity, they take the appearance of spiral waves. We call these VFOs \"re-entrant\". The behavior of the axonal plexus depends on the reliability with which action potentials propagate from one axon to the next, which, in turn, depends on the somatic membrane potential V (s) and the gap junction conductance g (gj). To study these dependencies, we impose a fixed value of V (s), then study the effects of varying V (s) and g (gj). Not surprisingly, propagation becomes more reliable with rising V (s) and g (gj). Externally driven VFOs occur when V (s) and g (gj) are so high that propagation never fails. For lower V (s) or g (gj), propagation is nearly reliable, but fails in rare circumstances. Surprisingly, the parameter regime where this occurs is fairly large. Even a single propagation failure can trigger re-entrant VFOs in this regime. Lowering V (s) and g (gj) further, one finds a third parameter regime in which propagation is unreliable, and no VFOs arise. We analyze these three parameter regimes by means of computations using model networks adapted from Traub et al., as well as much smaller model networks."}], "ArticleTitle": "Mechanisms of very fast oscillations in networks of axons coupled by gap junctions."}}, "120910": {"19501633": {"mesh": ["Action Potentials", "Animals", "Axons", "Cell Communication", "Computer Simulation", "Dendrites", "Electric Stimulation", "Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials", "Ganglia, Invertebrate", "Gap Junctions", "Leeches", "Models, Theoretical", "Neurons", "Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Software", "Synaptic Transmission"], "AbstractText": [{"section": null, "text": "Dendritic electrical coupling increases the number of effective synaptic inputs onto neurones by allowing the direct spread of synaptic potentials from one neurone to another.

A simple analytical model for ANT responses is extended to include temporal response properties, including the nonlinear-phase effects of the cochlear amplifier. Use of simple analytical models for AN discharge patterns allows quantification of the contributions of level-dependent aspects of the patterns to level discrimination. Specifically, the individual and combined contributions of the information contained in discharge rate, synchrony, and relative phase cues are explicitly examined for level discrimination of tonal stimuli. It is shown that the rate information provided by individual AN fibers is more constrained by increases in variance with increases in rate than by saturation. As noted in previous studies, there is sufficient average-rate information within a narrow-CF region to account for robust behavioral performance over a wide dynamic range; however, there is no model based on a simple limitation or use of AN information consistent with parametric variations in performance. This issue is explored in the current study through analysis of performance based on different aspects of AN patterns. For example, we show that performance predicted from use of all rate information degrades significantly as level increases above low-medium levels, inconsistent with Weber's Law. At low frequencies, synchrony information extends the range over which behavioral performance can be explained by 10-15 dB, but only at low levels. In contrast to rate and synchrony, nonlinear-phase cues are shown to provide robust information at medium and high levels in near-CF fibers for low-frequency stimuli. The level dependence of the discharge rate and phase properties of AN fibers are influenced by the compressive nonlinearity of the inner ear.

In this layer, granule cells (GrCs) receive the majority of sensory inputs to the cerebellum through the mossy fibers. Information flow at these neurons is gated by a specialized pacemaker interneuron known as the Golgi cell, which provides divergent GABAergic input to thousands of GrCs.

The new models capture the input-output relationships for both current injection and spiking input with remarkable accuracy, despite the order of magnitude decrease in system size.

We find that the stability types are not changed by dopamine activation, and our models predict that the MSN is never bistable. Nonetheless, the MSN models can produce a spontaneously bimodal membrane potential similar to that recently observed in vitro following application of NMDA agonists. We demonstrate that this bimodality is created by modelling the agonist effects as slow, irregular and massive jumps in NMDA conductance and, rather than a form of bistability, is due to the voltage-dependent blockade of NMDA receptors. Our models also predict a more pronounced membrane potential bimodality following D1 receptor activation.

Computer modeling presents an ideal tool to investigate how intrinsic voltage-gated conductances in DCN neurons could generate the heterogeneous firing behavior observed, and what input conditions could result in rebound responses.

Using a stochastic model with calcium microdomains, we predict that intracellular Ca(2+) fluctuations resulting from Ca(2+) channel gating can increase SK2 subthreshold activity by 1-2 orders of magnitude.

To explain the underlying mechanism, we show how short, high-amplitude calcium pulses associated with stochastic gating of calcium channels are much more effective at activating SK2 channels than the steady calcium signal produced by a deterministic simulation. This stochastic amplification results from two factors: first, a supralinear rise in the SK2 channel's steady-state activation curve at low calcium levels and, second, a momentary reduction in the channel's time constant during the calcium pulse, causing the channel to approach its steady-state activation value much faster than it decays.

There was an internal latency difference for the two excitatory pathways that would, if left uncompensated, position the ITD response function too far outside the physiological range to be useful for estimating ITD. We demonstrate, and support using a biophysically based computational model, that a bilateral asymmetry in excitatory post-synaptic potential (EPSP) slopes provides a robust compensatory delay mechanism due to differential activation of low threshold potassium conductance on these inputs and permits MSO neurons to encode physiological ITDs.

This was investigated with a biophysical computer model in which we showed that subtle changes in the relative strengths of circadian input could produce a phase shift in hippocampal neural activity. MRI provided evidence that the medial septum, a putative circadian relay center for the hippocampus, exhibits signs of damage and therefore could contribute to local circadian impairment.

We study rate models of circuits that include RS cells and LTS and FS inhibitory cells with short-term synaptic plasticity.

ClC-2 is an inward-rectifying chloride channel that is thought to help extrude chloride because inward rectification should, in principle, allow ClC-2 to act as a one-way chloride exit valve.

Using computer modeling, we reproduced voltage-clamp experiments showing chloride efflux via ClC-2, but testing the same model under physiological conditions revealed that ClC-2 normally leaks chloride into the cell. The discrepancy is explained by the driving force conditions that exist under artificial versus physiological conditions, and by the fact that ClC-2 rectification is neither complete nor instantaneous. Thus, contrary to previous assertions that ClC-2 helps maintain synaptic inhibition by lowering [Cl(-)](i), our simulations show that ClC-2 mediates chloride influx, thus producing outward current and directly reducing excitability.

How this precision is achieved by neuronal populations, whose membrane properties and total input may be quite heterogeneous, is nevertheless unknown. In this note, we investigate a simple mechanism for learning precise LFP-to-spike coupling in feed-forward networks - the reliable, periodic modulation of presynaptic firing rates during oscillations, coupled with spike-timing dependent plasticity. When oscillations are within the biological range (2-150&#8201;Hz), firing rates of the inputs change on a timescale highly relevant to spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP). Through analytic and computational methods, we find points of stable phase-locking for a neuron with plastic input synapses. These points correspond to precise phase-locking behavior in the feed-forward network. The location of these points depends on the oscillation frequency of the inputs, the STDP time constants, and the balance of potentiation and de-potentiation in the STDP rule. For a given input oscillation, the balance of potentiation and de-potentiation in the STDP rule is the critical parameter that determines the phase at which an output neuron will learn to spike.

Therefore, the mechanism of activity transition is a key to understand basal ganglia functions. As synchronization in GPe neurons could induce pathological STN rebound bursts, it is important to study how synchrony is generated in the GPe. To clarify this issue, we applied the phase-reduction technique to a conductance-based GPe neuronal model in order to derive the phase response curve (PRC) and interaction function between coupled GPe neurons. Using the PRC and interaction function, we studied how the steady-state activity of the GPe network depends on intrinsic membrane properties, varying ionic conductances on the membrane. We noted that a change in persistent sodium current, fast delayed rectifier Kv3 potassium current, M-type potassium current and small conductance calcium-dependent potassium current influenced the PRC shape and the steady state. The effect of those currents on the PRC shape could be attributed to extension of the firing period and reduction of the phase response immediately after an action potential.

In this study, we used high temporal and spatial resolution voltage-sensitive dye imaging to assess the characteristics of dendritic voltage deflections in response to Na/K action potentials in interneurons of the mouse dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus. We found that trains or single action potentials elicited by somatic current injection or local synaptic stimulation rapidly and actively backpropagated throughout the entire dendritic arbor and into the fine filiform dendritic appendages known to release GABAergic vesicles. Action potentials always appeared first in the soma or proximal dendrite in response to somatic current injection or local synaptic stimulation, and the rapid backpropagation into the dendritic arbor depended upon voltage-gated sodium and tetraethylammonium chloride-sensitive potassium channels. Our results indicate that thalamic interneuron dendrites integrate synaptic inputs that initiate action potentials, most likely in the axon initial segment, that then backpropagate with high fidelity into the dendrites, resulting in a nearly synchronous release of GABA from both axonal and dendritic compartments."}], "ArticleTitle": "Active action potential propagation but not initiation in thalamic interneuron dendrites."}}, "143671": {"22031773": {"mesh": ["Action Potentials", "Animals", "Axons", "Cats", "Computer Simulation", "Dendrites", "Humans", "Models, Neurological", "Motor Neurons", "Recruitment, Neurophysiological", "Synapses", "Synaptic Transmission"], "AbstractText": [{"section": null, "text": "Motoneuron discharge patterns reflect the interaction of synaptic inputs with intrinsic conductances.

However, PIC activation is also influenced by the pattern and spatial distribution of inhibitory inputs that are activated concurrently with excitatory inputs. To estimate the potential contributions of PIC activation and synaptic input patterns to motor unit discharge patterns, we examined the responses of a set of cable motoneuron models to different patterns of excitatory and inhibitory inputs.

Specifically, simulated N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) channels with a long decay time constant at granule and Golgi cells were responsible for the long temporal integration. Thus, blocking the NMDA channels or ablating Golgi cells impaired the POT representation. Simulated glomerulus structure made POT representation robust against noise in mossy fibre inputs. Long-term potentiation induced at mossy fibre synapses on granule cells also served to enhance the robustness. We reproduced some experimental results of Pavlovian delay eyeblink conditioning using the present model.

Experimental measurements show that a BAP evoked by current injection at the soma causes calcium currents in the apical shaft whose amplitudes decay with distance from the soma.

When the input to this system comes from timed past events represented by decaying delay activity, the pattern of synaptic connections can be set such that synchronization occurs only for selected spatiotemporal patterns. We show how the recognition is invariant to uniform time warp and uniform intensity change of the input events. The fundamental recognition event is a transient collective synchronization, representing \"many neurons now agree,\" an event that is then detected easily by a cell with a small time constant.

Consistent with OSI, the rate of Kv3.4 inactivation (i.e., the negative first derivative of double-pulse inactivation) precisely superimposes on the profile of the Kv3.4 current evoked by a single pulse because the channels must open to inactivate. In contrast, the rate of Kv4.2 inactivation is asynchronous, already changing at earlier times relative to the profile of the Kv4.2 current evoked by a single pulse. Thus, Kv4.2 inactivation occurs uncoupled from channel opening, indicating CSI. Furthermore, the inactivation time constant versus voltage relation of Kv3.4 decreases monotonically with depolarization and levels off, whereas that of Kv4.2 exhibits a J-shape profile.

However, so far most computational models of the MAPK cascade have been system-specific, or to reflect a particular type among the wide spectrum of possible dynamics. To obtain a general and integrated view of the relationship between the dynamics of MAPK activation and the structures and parameters of the MAPK cascade, we constructed a generic model by comparing previous models covering different specific biological systems. We assumed that reliable qualitative results could be predicted through a qualitative model with pseudo parameters. We used randomly sampled parameters instead of a specific set of \"best-fit\" parameters to avoid biases towards any particular systems. A range of dynamics behaviors for MAPK activation, including ultrasensitivity, bistability, transient activation and oscillation, were successfully predicted by the generic model. The results indicated that the steady state dynamics (ultrasensitivity and bistability) was jointly determined by the three-tiered structure of the MAPK cascade and the competitive substrate binding in the dual-phosphorylation processes of the central components, while the temporal dynamics (transient activation and oscillation) was mainly affected by the upstream signaling pathway and feedbacks. Moreover, MAPK kinase (MAPKK) played more important roles than the other two components in determining the dynamics of MAPK activation.

Results demonstrate that acquisition, but not recall, of novel discrimination problems is impaired following blockade of OB cholinergic receptors, although the relative contribution of muscarinic and nicotinic receptors depends on task difficulty.

However, simulations of the model in electrotonic equivalent cables prove that Ca plateaus (resp. valleys) are conducted over the entire cell with velocities typical of passive events once they are triggered by threshold synaptic inputs that turn the membrane current inward (resp. outward) over the whole cell surface.

Since motor commands originate in the cortex, an important question is how the basal ganglia influence cortical information flow, and how this influence becomes pathological in PD. To explore this, we developed a composite neuronal network/neural field model. The network model consisted of 4950 spiking neurons, divided into 15 excitatory and inhibitory cell populations in the thalamus and cortex. The field model consisted of the cortex, thalamus, striatum, subthalamic nucleus, and globus pallidus. Both models have been separately validated in previous work. Three field models were used: one with basal ganglia parameters based on data from healthy individuals, one based on data from individuals with PD, and one purely thalamocortical model. Spikes generated by these field models were then used to drive the network model. Compared to the network driven by the healthy model, the PD-driven network had lower firing rates, a shift in spectral power toward lower frequencies, and higher probability of bursting; each of these findings is consistent with empirical data on PD. In the healthy model, we found strong Granger causality between cortical layers in the beta and low gamma frequency bands, but this causality was largely absent in the PD model. In particular, the reduction in Granger causality from the main \"input\" layer of the cortex (layer 4) to the main \"output\" layer (layer 5) was pronounced. This may account for symptoms of PD that seem to reflect deficits in information flow, such as bradykinesia. In general, these results demonstrate that the brain's large-scale oscillatory environment, represented here by the field model, strongly influences the information processing that occurs within its subnetworks.

As network parameters are changed from the range which produces complete synchrony to those favoring less synchronous dynamics, desynchronizing delayed feedback may gradually turn into synchronizing stimulation. This suggests that delayed feedback DBS in Parkinson's disease may boost rather than suppress synchronization and is unlikely to be clinically successful.

This was caused by reduced calcium entry and consequently reduced activation of calcium activated potassium channels. It is important to note that the main determinant of drug effect was resting membrane potential (RMP) and not action potential firing rate. Binding of phenytoin and carbamazepine is slow and, thus drug effects are largely determined by the long term state of the RMP. This paradoxical AP firing increase was dependent on the unusually large calcium-activated potassium conductances expressed by DG granule cells. This predicts that drug efficacy in a given network will depend on the precise makeup of conductances in the network. RMP is expected to vary with the level of activity in the network. We simulated the effects of drugs on single shot stimulus responses in networks with mossy fiber sprouting and varied the RMP in all neurons as a model for network activity. For an RMP of -50 mV, representing an active network, drugs had no effect, or in some cases, increased excitability.

However, this plasticity alone cannot account for the broad dynamic ranges and time scales of cerebellar adaptation. We therefore tested the role of plasticity distributed over multiple synaptic sites (Hansel et al., 2001; Gao et al., 2012) by generating an analog cerebellar model embedded into a control loop connected to a robotic simulator. The robot used a three-joint arm and performed repetitive fast manipulations with different masses along an 8-shape trajectory.

In this paper we have explored the putative role of the IO-DCN connection by endowing it with adaptable weights and exploring its implications in a closed-loop robotic manipulation task. Our results show that IO-DCN plasticity accelerates convergence of learning by up to two orders of magnitude without conflicting with the generalization properties conferred by DCN plasticity. Thus, this model suggests that multiple distributed learning mechanisms provide a key for explaining the complex properties of procedural learning and open up new experimental questions for synaptic plasticity in the cerebellar network.

Using dynamic-clamp techniques in thalamic slices in vitro, we combined theoretical and experimental approaches to implement a realistic hybrid retino-thalamo-cortical pathway mixing biological cells and simulated circuits. The synaptic bombardment of cortical origin was mimicked through the injection of a stochastic mixture of excitatory and inhibitory conductances, resulting in a gradable correlation level of afferent activity shared by thalamic cells. The study of the impact of the simulated cortical input on the global retinocortical signal transfer efficiency revealed a novel control mechanism resulting from the collective resonance of all thalamic relay neurons. We show here that the transfer efficiency of sensory input transmission depends on three key features: i) the number of thalamocortical cells involved in the many-to-one convergence from thalamus to cortex, ii) the statistics of the corticothalamic synaptic bombardment and iii) the level of correlation imposed between converging thalamic relay cells. In particular, our results demonstrate counterintuitively that the retinocortical signal transfer efficiency increases when the level of correlation across thalamic cells decreases. This suggests that the transfer efficiency of relay cells could be selectively amplified when they become simultaneously desynchronized by the cortical feedback.

This suggests that a facilitating mechanism is at work, presumably short-term synaptic facilitation, as well as two fatigue mechanisms: one with a short timescale, presumably short-term synaptic depression, and another one with a longer timescale, presumably cellular adaptation. We thus incorporated these three mechanisms into the SNN, which, indeed, produced realistic BNSs. Next, we systematically varied the recurrent excitation for various adaptation timescales. Strong excitability led to frequent, quasi-periodic BNSs (CV~0), and weak excitability led to rare BNSs, approaching a Poisson process (CV~1).

The nature and magnitude of the PC input is a function of the distance to the place field center, which is inferred from rate decoding. A biologically plausible learning rule drives the evolution of the connection strengths from PCs to a GC. In this model, PCs compete for GC activation, and the plasticity rule favors efficient packing of the space representation. This leads to gridlike firing patterns. In a new environment, GCs continuously recruit new PCs to cover the entire space. The model described here makes important predictions and can represent the feedforward connections from hippocampus CA1 to deeper mEC layers.

Calcium is essential for synaptic plasticity in the striatum, and these large calcium transients during the upstates may control which synapses undergo plastic changes. To investigate the mechanisms that underlie the relationship between calcium and AP timing, we have developed a realistic biophysical model of a medium spiny neuron (MSN). We have implemented sophisticated calcium dynamics including calcium diffusion, buffering, and pump extrusion, which accurately replicate published data. Using this model, we found that either the slow inactivation of dendritic sodium channels (NaSI) or the calcium inactivation of voltage-gated calcium channels (CDI) can cause high calcium corresponding to early APs and lower calcium corresponding to later APs. We found that only CDI can account for the experimental observation that sensitivity to AP timing is dependent on NMDA receptors. Additional simulations demonstrated a mechanism by which MSNs can dynamically modulate their sensitivity to AP timing and show that sensitivity to specifically timed pre- and postsynaptic pairings (as in spike timing-dependent plasticity protocols) is altered by the timing of the pairing within the upstate.

Here, we present a general electrodiffusive formalism for modeling of ion concentration dynamics in a one-dimensional geometry, including both the intra- and extracellular domains. Based on the Nernst-Planck equations, this formalism ensures that the membrane potential and ion concentrations are in consistency, it ensures global particle/charge conservation and it accounts for diffusion and concentration dependent variations in resistivity. We apply the formalism to a model of astrocytes exchanging ions with the extracellular space. The simulations show that K(+)-removal from high-concentration regions is driven by a local depolarization of the astrocyte membrane, which concertedly (i) increases the local astrocytic uptake of K(+), (ii) suppresses extracellular transport of K(+), (iii) increases axial transport of K(+) within astrocytes, and (iv) facilitates astrocytic relase of K(+) in regions where the extracellular concentration is low. Together, these mechanisms seem to provide a robust regulatory scheme for shielding the extracellular space from excess K(+).

Using mechanistic models of the development of neural connectivity in V1, we show for the first time that realistic stable, robust, and adaptive map development can be achieved by including two low-level mechanisms originally motivated from single-neuron results.

First, we constructed models of canonical OB circuits that included mono- and disynaptic feedforward excitation, recurrent inhibition and feedforward inhibition of the MC.

The synaptic depression, in turn, is associated with a decrease in Ca2+ currents in the sensory neurons, whereas presynaptic facilitation with increased Ca2+ currents produced indirectly by a decrease in a novel serotonergic sensitive K+ current. The present work represents an initial quantitative examination of the extent to which these mechanisms account for each of these types of synaptic plasticity. To address these issues a lumped parameter mathematical model of the sensory neuron release process was constructed. Major components of this model include Ca2+-channel inactivation, Ca2+-mediated neurotransmitter release and mobilization, and readily releasable and upstream feeding pools of neurotransmitter. In the model, release of neurotransmitter has a linear function of Ca2+ concentration and is not affected directly by residual Ca2+. The model not only simulates the data of synaptic depression and recovery from depression, but also qualitatively predicts other features of neurotransmitter release that it was not designed to fit. These include features of synaptic depression with high and low levels of transmitter release, posttetanic potentiation, a steep relationship between action potential duration and transmitter release, enhanced release produced by broadening the sensory neuron action potential (presynaptic facilitation), and dramatic synaptic depression with two closely spaced tetraethylammonium (TEA) spikes. The model cannot account fully for synaptic depression with empirically observed somatic Ca2+-current kinetics. Rather a large component of synaptic depression is due to reduction to the pools of releasable neurotransmitter (depletion).

An essential component of neurites is the cytoskeleton of microtubules, long polymers of tubulin dimers running throughout the entire neurite. To investigate whether competition between neurites can emerge from the dynamics of a resource such as tubulin, we developed a multi-compartmental model of neurite growth. In the model, tubulin is produced in the soma and transported by diffusion and active transport to the growth cones at the tip of the neurites, where it is assembled into microtubules to elongate the neurite. Just as in experimental studies, we find that the outgrowth of a neurite branch can lead to the simultaneous retraction of its neighboring branches. We show that these competitive interactions occur in simple neurite morphologies as well as in complex neurite arborizations and that in developing neurons competition for a growth resource such as tubulin can account for the differential outgrowth of neurite branches. The model predicts that competition between neurite branches decreases with path distance between growth cones, increases with path distance from growth cone to soma, and decreases with a higher rate of active transport. Together, our results suggest that competition between outgrowing neurites can already emerge from relatively simple and basic dynamics of a growth resource.

Such correlations are irrelevant and can reduce coding efficiency by introducing redundancy.

These together constitute the \"DA=RPE\" hypothesis, which describes the mutual interaction between DA and the CBG circuits and serves as the primary working hypothesis in studying reward learning and value-based decision-making.

We explored whether such ramping DA could be explained by extending the \"DA=RPE\" hypothesis by taking into account biological properties of the CBG circuits. In particular, we examined effects of possible time-dependent decay of DA-dependent plastic changes of synaptic strengths by incorporating decay of learned values into the RPE-based reinforcement learning model and simulating reward learning tasks. We then found that incorporation of such a decay dramatically changes the model's behavior, causing gradual ramping of RPE. Moreover, we further incorporated magnitude-dependence of the rate of decay, which could potentially be in accord with some past observations, and found that near-sigmoidal ramping of RPE, resembling the observed DA ramping, could then occur.

We also rule out some alternative mechanisms. In our mechanism, we predict that a few distant mitral cells receiving input from different receptors, inhibit sister mitral cells differentially, by activating disjoint subsets of granule cells.

One such strategy for protein transport is for the proteins of the JNK signaling cascade to bind to scaffolds, and to have the whole protein-scaffold cargo transported by kinesin motors along microtubules. We show how this strategy outperforms protein transport by diffusion alone, using metrics such as signaling rate and signal amplification. We find that there exists a range of scaffold concentrations for which JNK transport is optimal. Increase in scaffold concentration increases signaling rate and signal amplification but an excess of scaffolds results in the dilution of reactants. Similarly, there exists a range of kinesin motor speeds for which JNK transport is optimal. Signaling rate and signal amplification increases with kinesin motor speed until the speed of motor translocation becomes faster than kinase/scaffold-motor binding. Finally, we suggest experiments that can be performed to validate whether, in physiological conditions, neuronal cells do indeed adopt such an optimal strategy.

We collected voltage-clamp data from the literature and we found, based on a theoretical criterion, that the properties of Na inactivation could indeed cause substantial threshold variability by itself. By analyzing simple neuron models with fast Na inactivation (one channel subtype), we found that the spike threshold is correlated with the mean membrane potential and negatively correlated with the preceding depolarization slope, consistent with experiments.

Within a dendritic layer, peak spine head calcium levels are either a linear or sigmoidal function of the number of coactive synapses, with nonlinearity depending on the ability of voltage spread in the dendrites to reach calcium spike threshold. This is strongly controlled by the potassium A-type current, with calcium spikes and the consequent sigmoidal increase in peak spine head calcium present only when the A-channel density is low. Other membrane characteristics influence the gain of the relationship between peak calcium and the number of active synapses. In particular, increasing spine neck resistance increases the gain due to increased voltage responses to synaptic input in spine heads. Colocation of stimulated synapses on a single dendritic branch also increases the gain of the response.

Our experimental studies demonstrated two specific changes in FS-BC GABA currents following experimental seizures [Yu et al., J.

Networks of FS-BCs interconnected by fast GABAergic synapses developed synchronous firing in the dentate gamma frequency range (40-100 Hz). Systematic investigation revealed that the biologically realistic range of 30 to 40 connections between FS-BCs resulted in greater coherence in the gamma frequency range when networks were activated by Poisson-distributed dendritic synaptic inputs rather than by homogeneous somatic current injections, which were balanced for FS-BC firing frequency in unconnected networks. Distance-dependent conduction delay enhanced coherence in networks with 30-40 FS-BC interconnections while inclusion of gap junctional conductance had a modest effect on coherence. In networks activated by somatic current injections resulting in heterogeneous FS-BC firing, increasing g(GABA-extra) reduced the frequency and coherence of FS-BC firing when E(GABA) was shunting (-74 mV), but failed to alter average FS-BC frequency when E(GABA) was depolarizing (-54 mV). When FS-BCs were activated by biologically based dendritic synaptic inputs, enhancing g(GABA-extra) reduced the frequency and coherence of FS-BC firing when E(GABA) was shunting and increased average FS-BC firing when E(GABA) was depolarizing. Shifting E(GABA) from shunting to depolarizing potentials consistently increased network frequency to and above high gamma frequencies (>80 Hz).

To investigate whether interactions between different networks could contribute to the variety of oscillation patterns, we created two model networks, one generating on its own a relatively slow frequency (20 Hz; slow network) and one generating a fast frequency (32 Hz; fast network). Taking either the slow or the fast network as source network projecting connections to the other, or target, network, we systematically investigated how type and strength of inter-network connections affected target network activity. For high inter-network connection strengths, we found that the slow network was more effective at completely imposing its rhythm on the fast network than the other way around. The strongest entrainment occurred when excitatory cells of the slow network projected to excitatory or inhibitory cells of the fast network. The fast network most strongly imposed its rhythm on the slow network when its excitatory cells projected to excitatory cells of the slow network. Interestingly, for lower inter-network connection strengths, multiple frequencies coexisted in the target network. Just as observed in rat prefrontal cortex, the target network could express multiple frequencies at the same time, alternate between two distinct oscillation frequencies, or express a single frequency with alternating episodes of high and low amplitude. Together, our results suggest that input from other oscillating networks may markedly alter a network's frequency spectrum and may partly be responsible for the rich repertoire of temporal oscillation patterns observed in the brain.

The results suggest CA3-CA1 synapses are potentiated on one phase of theta due to high calcium levels provided by paired weak CA3 and layer III entorhinal cortex (EC) inputs even when somatic spiking is inhibited by perisomatic interneuron activity. Weak CA3 inputs alone induce lower calcium transients and result in depression of the CA3-CA1 synapses. These synapses are depressed if activated in phase with dendritic inhibition as strong CA3 inputs alone are not able to cause high calcium in this theta phase even though the CA1 pyramidal neuron shows somatic spiking.

However, it is still unclear at what level or levels of the olfactory pathway this segregation of information occurs. In this work, we study whether this odor information segregation is performed at the input stage of the olfactory bulb: the glomerular layer. To this end, we built a detailed neural model of the glomerular layer based on its known anatomical connections and conducted two simulated odor experiments. In the first experiment, the model was exposed to an odor stimulus dataset composed of six different odorants, each one dosed at six different concentrations. In the second experiment, we conducted an odor morphing experiment where a sequence of binary mixtures going from one odor to another through intermediate mixtures was presented to the model. The results of the experiments were visualized using principal components analysis and analyzed with hierarchical clustering to unveil the structure of the high-dimensional output space. Additionally, Fisher's discriminant ratio and Pearson's correlation coefficient were used to quantify odor identity and odor concentration information respectively. Our results showed that the architecture of the glomerular layer was able to mediate the segregation of odor information obtaining output spiking sequences of the principal neurons, namely the mitral and external tufted cells, strongly correlated with odor identity and concentration, respectively.

Thus, our model predicts that the same feedback pathway can simultaneously reduce both signal and noise correlations through independent mechanisms.

The modeling of functional deficits in neurites as a consequence of macroscopic mechanical insults has been rarely explored.

In this paper, we present the implementation details of this model: a finite difference parallel program for simulating electrical signal propagation along neurites under mechanical loading. Following the application of a macroscopic strain at a given strain rate produced by a mechanical insult, Neurite is able to simulate the resulting neuronal electrical signal propagation, and thus the corresponding functional deficits. The simulation of the coupled mechanical and electrophysiological behaviors requires computational expensive calculations that increase in complexity as the network of the simulated cells grows.

The DMN deactivation made Nsen Ia cells cease firing, thereby stopping the glial membrane hyperpolarization, quitting the GABA import, returning to the basal ambient GABA level, and thus enhancing global inhibition. Notably, the stimulus-relevant P cell firing could be maintained when GABAergic gliotransmission via Ia-glia signaling worked, decreasing ambient GABA concentration around the stimulus-relevant P cells. This enabled the Nsen to reliably detect the stimulus. We suggest that intrinsic default model network activity may accelerate the reaction speed of the sensory network by modulating its ongoing-spontaneous activity in a subthreshold manner. Ambient GABA contributes to achieve an optimal ongoing spontaneous subthreshold neuronal state, in which GABAergic gliotransmission triggered by the intrinsic default model network activity may play an important role.

Here we use a computational network model of medium spiny neurons (MSNs)-fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs), based on data from several mammalian species, and find that robust &#946;-band oscillations and imbalanced firing emerge from implementation of changes to cellular and circuit properties caused by dopamine depletion.

The model reveals that the reduced decorrelation between MSNs attributable to weakened lateral inhibition enables the strong influence of synchronous FSIs on MSN firing and oscillations. Weakened lateral inhibition also produces an increased sensitivity of MSN output to cortical correlation, a condition relevant to the parkinsonian striatum. The oscillations of FSIs, in turn, are strongly modulated by fast electrical transmission between FSIs through gap junctions.

We also show experimentally that high slope values, and the sensitivity to the slow Ca2+ chelator EGTA-AM, are maintained with developmental maturation of the calyx synapse. Taken together, domain overlap control of release represents a highly organized active zone architecture in which Ca2+ channels must obey a certain distance to docked vesicles.

Modeling studies have recently confirmed that balanced random networks are indeed capable of amplifying weakly tuned inputs and generating highly selective output responses, even in absence of feature-selective recurrent connectivity. Here we seek to elucidate the neuronal mechanisms underlying this phenomenon by resorting to networks of integrate-and-fire neurons, which are amenable to analytic treatment. Specifically, in networks of perfect integrate-and-fire neurons, we observe that highly selective and contrast invariant output responses emerge, very similar to networks of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons. We then demonstrate that a theory based on mean firing rates and the detailed network topology predicts the output responses, and explains the mechanisms underlying the suppression of the common-mode, amplification of modulation, and contrast invariance. Increasing inhibition dominance in our networks makes the rectifying nonlinearity more prominent, which in turn adds some distortions to the otherwise essentially linear prediction. An extension of the linear theory can account for all the distortions, enabling us to compute the exact shape of every individual tuning curve in our networks. We show that this simple form of nonlinearity adds two important properties to orientation selectivity in the network, namely sharpening of tuning curves and extra suppression of the modulation. The theory can be further extended to account for the nonlinearity of the leaky model by replacing the rectifier by the appropriate smooth input-output transfer function.

For this to work, however, two conditions must be satisfied: First, orientation selective neuronal responses must exist before specific recurrent synaptic connections can be established. Second, Hebbian learning must be compatible with the recurrent network dynamics contributing to orientation selectivity, and the resulting specific connectivity must remain stable for unspecific background activity. Previous studies have mainly focused on very simple models, where the receptive fields of neurons were essentially determined by feedforward mechanisms, and where the recurrent network was small, lacking the complex recurrent dynamics of large-scale networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Here we studied the emergence of functionally specific connectivity in large-scale recurrent networks with synaptic plasticity. Our results show that balanced random networks, which already exhibit highly selective responses at eye opening, can develop feature-specific connectivity if appropriate rules of synaptic plasticity are invoked within and between excitatory and inhibitory populations. If these conditions are met, the initial orientation selectivity guides the process of Hebbian learning and, as a result, functionally specific and a surplus of bidirectional connections emerge.

In tuning our models, we found that different kinetics and non-uniform distributions could better reproduce experimental O-LM cell responses. In contrast to CA1 pyramidal cells where higher conductance densities of h-channels occur in more distal dendrites, decreasing conductance densities of h-channels away from the soma were observed in O-LM models. Via an illustrative scenario, we showed that having dendritic h-channels clearly speeds up back-propagating action potentials in O-LM cells, unlike when h-channels are present only in the soma. Although the present results were morphology-dependent, our work shows that it should be possible to determine the distributions and characteristics of O-LM cells with recordings and morphologies from the same cell.

Using the well-studied gastric mill pattern generator of the crab, we show that modest temperature increase can abolish rhythmic activity in isolated neural circuits due to increased leak currents in rhythm-generating neurons. Dynamic clamp-mediated addition of leak currents was sufficient to stop neuronal oscillations at low temperatures, and subtraction of additional leak currents at elevated temperatures was sufficient to rescue the rhythm. Despite the apparent sensitivity of the isolated nervous system to temperature fluctuations, the rhythm could be stabilized by activating extrinsic neuromodulatory inputs from descending projection neurons, a strategy that we indeed found to be implemented in intact animals. In the isolated nervous system, temperature compensation was achieved by stronger extrinsic neuromodulatory input from projection neurons or by augmenting projection neuron influence via bath application of the peptide cotransmitter Cancer borealis tachykinin-related peptide Ia (CabTRP Ia). CabTRP Ia activates the modulator-induced current IMI (a nonlinear voltage-gated inward current) that effectively acted as a negative leak current and counterbalanced the temperature-induced leak to rescue neuronal oscillations. Computational modelling revealed the ability of IMI to reduce detrimental leak-current influences on neuronal networks over a broad conductance range and indicated that leak and IMI are closely coregulated in the biological system to enable stable motor patterns.

This suggests that signaling by &#946;-adrenergic receptors depends on temporal pattern of stimulation, and that switching may represent a novel mechanism for recruiting kinases involved in synaptic plasticity and memory.

Based on in vivo recordings and biophysical modeling of the mammalian olfactory bulb (OB), we propose a general scheme where OB internal dynamics can sustain two distinct dynamic states, each dominated by either a gamma or a beta regime. The occurrence of each regime depends on the excitability level of granule cells, the main OB interneurons. Using this model framework, we demonstrate how the balance between sensory and centrifugal input can control the switch between the two oscillatory dynamic states. In parallel, we experimentally observed that sensory and centrifugal inputs to the rat OB could both be modulated by the respiration of the animal (2-12 Hz) and each one phase shifted with the other. Implementing this phase shift in our model resulted in the appearance of the alternation between gamma and beta rhythms within a single respiratory cycle, as in our experimental results under urethane anesthesia. Our theoretical framework can also account for the oscillatory frequency response, depending on the odor intensity, the odor valence, and the animal sniffing strategy observed under various conditions including animal freely-moving.

Our analysis reveals (1) the dynamic features of signaling that significantly alter transcriptional regulatory patterns (encoding), and (2) the temporal history of signaling that can be inferred from single cell scale snapshots of transcriptional activity (decoding). Immediate early gene expression patterns were informative of signaling peak retention kinetics, whereas transcription factor activity patterns were informative of activation and deactivation kinetics of signaling. Moreover, the information processing aspects varied across the network, with each component encoding a selective subset of the dynamic signaling features. We developed novel sensitivity and information transfer maps to unravel the dynamic multiplexing of signaling features at each of these network components. Unsupervised clustering of the maps revealed two groups that aligned with network motifs distinguished by transcriptional feedforward vs feedback interactions.

Very little is known about the factors that influence the generation of these global NMDA-spikes, as well the potentially distinct rules of synaptic integration and the computational significance conferred by the two types of NMDA-spikes. Here I show that the input resistance (RIN) plays a major role in influencing spike initiation; while the classical, focal NMDA-spike depended upon the local (dendritic) RIN, the threshold of global NMDA-spike generation was set by the somatic RIN. As cellular morphology can exert a large influence on RIN, morphologically distinct neuron types can have dissimilar rules for NMDA-spikes generation. For example, cortical neurons in superficial layers were found to be generally prone to global NMDA-spike generation. In contrast, electric properties of cortical layer 5b cells clearly favor focal NMDA-spikes. These differences can translate into diverse synaptic integration rules for the different classes of cortical cells; simulated superficial layers neurons were found to exhibit strong synaptic interactions between different dendritic branches, giving rise to a single integrative compartment mediated by the global NMDA-spike. In these cells, efficiency of postsynaptic activation was relatively little dependent on synaptic distribution. By contrast, layer 5b neurons were capable of true multi-unit computation involving independent integrative compartments formed by clustered synaptic input which could trigger focal NMDA-spikes.

In the first case, when the dendritic inhibition of pyramidal cells alone was reduced, the local field potential activity changed from a theta-modulated gamma pattern to a prominently gamma frequency pattern. In the second case, in addition to this reduction of dendritic inhibition, with a simultaneous large increase in the external excitatory inputs received by pyramidal cells, the basket cells entered a state of depolarization block, causing the network to generate a typical ictal activity pattern. In the third case, when the dendritic inhibition onto the pyramidal cells was reduced and changes were simultaneously made in synaptic connectivity between all neurons in the network, the basket cells were again observed to enter depolarization block. In the third case, impairment of dendritic inhibition required to generate an ictal activity pattern was lesser than the two previous cases. Moreover, the ictal like activity began earlier in the third case. Hence, our study suggests that greater synaptic plasticity occurring in the whole network due to increase in reception of external excitatory inputs (due to impaired dendritic inhibition) makes the network more susceptible to generation of epileptic activity."}], "ArticleTitle": "Impaired dendritic inhibition leads to epileptic activity in a computer model of CA3."}}, "186977": {"26635594": {"mesh": [], "AbstractText": [{"section": null, "text": "Oscillations in network activity are ubiquitous in the brain and are involved in diverse cognitive functions.

The h-current (Ih) is a slow, hyperpolarization-activated, depolarizing current that contributes to neuronal resonance and membrane potential. The impact of Ih on network oscillations, however, remains poorly understood. To elucidate the network effects of Ih, we used a computational model of a generic oscillatory neuronal network consisting of inhibitory and excitatory cells that were externally driven by excitatory action potentials and sustained depolarizing currents. We found that Ih increased the oscillation frequency and, in combination with external action potentials, representing input from areas outside the network, strongly decreased the synchrony of firing. As a consequence, the oscillation power and the duration of episodes during which the network exhibited high-amplitude oscillations were greatly reduced in the presence of Ih. Our results suggest that modulation of Ih or impaired expression of h-channels, as observed in epilepsy, could, by affecting oscillation dynamics, markedly alter network-level activity and potentially influence oscillation-dependent cognitive processes such as learning, memory and attention.

To ensure the stability of these traces in the presence of further learning, however, a regulation of plasticity appears beneficial.

We analyze temporal and spatial constraints of such a gating and investigate whether it is possible to suppress bAPs without a simultaneous annihilation of the forward-directed information flow via excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs). In a computational analysis of conductance-based multi-compartmental models, we demonstrate that a robust control of bAPs and calcium spikes is possible in an all-or-none manner, enabling a binary switch of coincidence signals and plasticity. The position of inhibitory synapses on the dendritic tree determines the spatial extent of the effect and allows a pathway-specific regulation of plasticity. With appropriate timing, EPSPs can still trigger somatic action potentials, although backpropagating signals are abolished. An annihilation of bAPs requires precisely timed inhibition, while the timing constraints are less stringent for distal calcium spikes. We further show that a wide-spread motif of local circuits-feedforward inhibition-is well suited to provide the temporal precision needed for the control of bAPs. Altogether, our model provides experimentally testable predictions and demonstrates that the inhibitory switch of plasticity can be a robust and attractive mechanism, hence assigning an additional function to the inhibitory elements of neuronal microcircuits beyond modulation of excitability.

In this study, we develop a network model of spiking neurons and systematically investigate the conditions, under which the network displays the emergent dynamic behaviors known from the Epileptor, which is a well-investigated abstract model of epileptic neural activity. This approach allows us to study the biophysical parameters and variables leading to epileptiform discharges at cellular and network levels. Our network model is composed of two neuronal populations, characterized by fast excitatory bursting neurons and regular spiking inhibitory neurons, embedded in a common extracellular environment represented by a slow variable. By systematically analyzing the parameter landscape offered by the simulation framework, we reproduce typical sequences of neural activity observed during status epilepticus. We find that exogenous fluctuations from extracellular environment and electro-tonic couplings play a major role in the progression of the seizure, which supports previous studies and further validates our model. We also investigate the influence of chemical synaptic coupling in the generation of spontaneous seizure-like events. Our results argue towards a temporal shift of typical spike waves with fast discharges as synaptic strengths are varied. We demonstrate that spike waves, including interictal spikes, are generated primarily by inhibitory neurons, whereas fast discharges during the wave part are due to excitatory neurons. Simulated traces are compared with in vivo experimental data from rodents at different stages of the disorder. We draw the conclusion that slow variations of global excitability, due to exogenous fluctuations from extracellular environment, and gap junction communication push the system into paroxysmal regimes. We discuss potential mechanisms underlying such machinery and the relevance of our approach, supporting previous detailed modeling studies and reflecting on the limitations of our methodology.

The utility of this hypothesis in the striatum is unclear in part because dopamine is required for striatal plasticity and in part because of the diversity in stimulation protocols. To test whether calcium can predict plasticity direction, we developed a calcium-based plasticity rule using a spiny projection neuron model with sophisticated calcium dynamics including calcium diffusion, buffering and pump extrusion. We utilized three spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) induction protocols, in which postsynaptic potentials are paired with precisely timed action potentials and the timing of such pairing determines whether potentiation or depression will occur. Results show that despite the variation in calcium dynamics, a single, calcium-based plasticity rule, which explicitly considers duration of calcium elevations, can explain the direction of synaptic weight change for all three STDP protocols. Additional simulations show that the plasticity rule correctly predicts the NMDA receptor dependence of long-term potentiation and the L-type channel dependence of long-term depression.

To investigate this, we built computational models that reproduce the switch from a normal spiking pattern characterized by a single spike at the onset of depolarization to a neuropathic one characterized by repetitive spiking throughout depolarization. Parameter changes that were sufficient to switch the spiking pattern also enabled membrane potential oscillations and bursting, suggesting that all three pathological changes are mechanistically linked. Dynamical analysis confirmed this prediction by showing that excitability changes co-develop when the nonlinear mechanism responsible for spike initiation switches from a quasi-separatrix-crossing to a subcritical Hopf bifurcation. This switch stems from biophysical changes that bias competition between oppositely directed fast- and slow-activating conductances operating at subthreshold potentials. Competition between activation and inactivation of a single conductance can be similarly biased with equivalent consequences for excitability. \"Bias\" can arise from a multitude of molecular changes occurring alone or in combination; in the latter case, changes can add or offset one another.

It is a mystery how pyramidal neurons integrate the input from thousands of synapses, what role the different dendrites play in this integration, and what kind of network behavior this enables in cortical tissue. It has been previously proposed that non-linear properties of dendrites enable cortical neurons to recognize multiple independent patterns. In this paper we extend this idea in multiple ways. First we show that a neuron with several thousand synapses segregated on active dendrites can recognize hundreds of independent patterns of cellular activity even in the presence of large amounts of noise and pattern variation. We then propose a neuron model where patterns detected on proximal dendrites lead to action potentials, defining the classic receptive field of the neuron, and patterns detected on basal and apical dendrites act as predictions by slightly depolarizing the neuron without generating an action potential. By this mechanism, a neuron can predict its activation in hundreds of independent contexts. We then present a network model based on neurons with these properties that learns time-based sequences. The network relies on fast local inhibition to preferentially activate neurons that are slightly depolarized.

We have previously shown that RPE can sustain if there is decay/forgetting of learned-values, which can be implemented as decay of synaptic strengths storing learned-values. This account, however, did not explain the suggested link between tonic/sustained DA and motivation.

Mathematical analyses revealed that underlying potential mechanisms are twofold: (1) decay-induced sustained RPE creates a gradient of 'Go' values towards a goal, and (2) value-contrasts between 'Go' and 'No-Go' are generated because while chosen values are continually updated, unchosen values simply decay. Our model provides potential explanations for the key experimental findings that suggest DA's roles in motivation: (i) slowdown of behavior by post-training blockade of DA signaling, (ii) observations that DA blockade severely impairs effortful actions to obtain rewards while largely sparing seeking of easily obtainable rewards, and (iii) relationships between the reward amount, the level of motivation reflected in the speed of behavior, and the average level of DA.

Decrease in the overall diffusivity of the glutamate may have straightforward consequences to the glutamate transients in the cleft. However, how spatial variation in the diffusivity may further affect glutamate transients is an intriguing aspect. Therefore, to understand the role of cleft heterogeneity, the present study adopts a novel approach of glutamate diffusion which considers a gamma statistical distribution of the diffusion coefficient of glutamate (Dglut) across the cleft space, such that its moments discernibly capture the dual impacts of the cleft composition, and further applies the framework of superstatistics. The findings reveal a power law behavior in the glutamate transients, akin to the long-range anomalous subdiffusion, which leads to slower decay profile of cleft glutamate at higher intensity of cleft heterogeneity.

The CA3 model exhibits quasi-synchronous population bursts, which give rise to sharp wave-like deep depolarizations in the CA1 dendritic layer accompanied by transient field oscillations at &#8776; 150-200 Hz in the somatic layer. The frequency and synchrony of these oscillations is based on interneuronal activity and fast-decaying recurrent inhibition in CA1.

To resolve this, we performed a voltage-clamp electrophysiological study in brain slices to describe their major ionic currents and then constructed a computer model and used simulations to understand the mechanisms behind autorhythmicity in silico. We found that vlPAG/DRN DA neurons exhibit a number of voltage-dependent currents activating in the subthreshold range including, a hyperpolarization-activated cation current (IH), a transient, A-type, potassium current (IA), a background, 'persistent' (INaP) sodium current and a transient, low voltage activated (LVA) calcium current (ICaLVA).

In contrast, when blocking sodium currents, spontaneous firing ceased and a stable, non-oscillating membrane potential below AP threshold was attained. Using the DA neuron model we further show that calcium currents exhibit little activation (compared to sodium) during the interspike interval (ISI) repolarization while, any individual potassium current alone, whose blockade positively modulated AP firing frequency, is not required for spontaneous firing.

While the initiation of pauses typically involves synaptic or modulatory input, intrinsic membrane properties may also enhance or limit hyperpolarization, raising the question of how intrinsic conductances shape pauses in dopamine neurons. Using retrograde labeling and electrophysiological techniques combined with computational modeling, we examined the intrinsic conductances that shape pauses evoked by current injections and synaptic stimulation in subpopulations of dopamine neurons grouped according to their axonal projections to the nucleus accumbens or dorsal striatum in mice. Testing across a range of conditions and pulse durations, we found that mesoaccumbal and nigrostriatal neurons differ substantially in rebound properties with mesoaccumbal neurons displaying significantly longer delays to spiking following hyperpolarization. The underlying mechanism involves an inactivating potassium (IA) current with decay time constants of up to 225 ms, and small-amplitude hyperpolarization-activated currents (IH), characteristics that were most often observed in mesoaccumbal neurons. Pharmacological block of IA completely abolished rebound delays and, importantly, shortened synaptically evoked inhibitory pauses, thereby demonstrating the involvement of A-type potassium channels in prolonging pauses evoked by GABAergic inhibition. Therefore, these results show that mesoaccumbal and nigrostriatal neurons display differential responses to hyperpolarizing inhibitory stimuli that favors a higher sensitivity to inhibition in mesoaccumbal neurons.

We show that pauses in dopamine neuron firing, evoked by either stimulation of GABAergic inputs or hyperpolarizing current injections, are enhanced by a subclass of potassium conductances that are recruited at voltages below spike threshold. Importantly, A-type potassium currents recorded in mesoaccumbal neurons displayed substantially slower inactivation kinetics, which, combined with weaker expression of hyperpolarization-activated currents, lengthened hyperpolarization-induced delays in spiking relative to nigrostriatal neurons.

We computed the steady-state activity of a large-scale model of the granular layer of the rat cerebellum. Within a few tens of milliseconds after the start of random mossy fiber input, the populations of Golgi and granule cells became entrained in a single synchronous oscillation, the basic frequency of which ranged from 10 to 40 Hz depending on the average rate of firing in the mossy fiber population. The long parallel fibers ensured, through alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid-mediated synapses, a coherent excitation of Golgi cells, while the regular firing of each Golgi cell synchronized all granule cells within its axonal radius through transient activation of their gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABAA) receptor synapses. Individual granule cells often remained silent during a few successive oscillation cycles so that their average firing rates, which could be quite variable, reflected the average activities of their mossy fiber afferents. The synchronous, rhythmic firing pattern was robust over a broad range of biologically realistic parameter values and to parameter randomization. Three conditions, however, made the oscillations more transient and could desynchronize the entire network in the end: a very low mossy fiber activity, a very dominant excitation of Golgi cells through mossy fiber synapses (rather than through parallel fiber synapses), and a tonic activation of granule cell GABAA receptors (with an almost complete absence of synaptically induced inhibitory postsynaptic currents). These three conditions were associated with a reduction in the parallel fiber activity, and synchrony could be restored by increasing the mossy fiber firing rate. The model predicts that, under conditions of strong mossy fiber input to the cerebellum, Golgi cells do not only control the strength of parallel fiber activity but also the timing of the individual spikes.

As in previous studies, the LIF progressively became selective to the repeating pattern with no supervision, even when the pattern was embedded in Poisson activity. Here we show that, using certain STDP parameters, the resulting pattern detector is optimal. These mechanisms may explain how humans learn repeating sensory sequences. Long sequences could be recognized thanks to coincidence detectors working at a much shorter timescale.

Identical frozen Gaussian noise current traces were injected into TCR neurons in rat brain slices as well as in a validated three-compartment TCR model cell. The resulting membrane voltage traces and spike trains were analyzed by calculating the coherence and impedance. Reverse correlation techniques gave the Event-Triggered Average (ETA) and the Event-Triggered Covariance (ETC).

A network model of thalamocortical (TC) and thalamic reticular (RE) neurons was developed based on electrophysiological measurements in ferret thalamic slices. Single-compartment TC and RE cells included voltage- and calcium-sensitive currents described by Hodgkin-Huxley type of kinetics. Synaptic currents were modeled by kinetic models of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA), gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABAA) and GABAB receptors. 2. The model reproduced successfully the characteristics of spindle and slow bicuculline-induced oscillations observed in vitro. The characteristics of these two types of oscillations depended on both the intrinsic properties of TC and RE cells and their pattern of interconnectivity. 3. The oscillations were organized by the reciprocal recruitment between TC and RE cells, due to their manual connectivity and bursting properties. TC cells elicited AMPA-mediated excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in RE cells, whereas RE cells elicited a mixture of GABAA and GABAB inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) in TC cells. Because of the presence of a T current, sufficiently strong EPSPs could elicit a burst in RE cells, and TC cells could generate a rebound burst following GABAergic IPSPs. Under these conditions, interaction between the TC and RE cells produced sustained oscillations. 4. In the absence of spontaneous oscillation in any cell, the TC-RE network remained quiescent. Spindle oscillations with a frequency of 9-11 Hz could be initiated by stimulation of either TC or RE neurons. A few spontaneously oscillating TC neurons recruited the entire network model into a \"waxing-and waning\" oscillation. These \"initiator\" cells could be an extremely small proportion of TC cells. 5. In intracellular recordings, TC cells display a reduced ability for burst firing after a sequence of bursts. The \"waning\" phase of spindles was reproduced in the network model by assuming an activity-dependent upregulation of Ih operating via a calcium-binding protein in TC cells, as shown previously in a two-cell model. 6. Following the global suppression of GABAA inhibition, the disinhibited RE cells produced prolonged burst discharges that elicited strong GABAB-mediated currents in TC cells. The enhancement of slow IPSPs in TC cells was also due to cooperativity in the activation of GABAB-mediated current. These slow IPSPs recruited TC and RE cells into slower waxing-and-waning oscillations (3-4 HZ) that were even more highly synchronized. 7. Local axonal arborization of the TC to RE and RE to TC projections allowed oscillations to propagate through the network. An oscillation starting at a single focus induced a propagating wavefront as more cells were recruited progressively. The waning of the oscillation also propagated due to upregulation of Ih in TC cells, leading to waves of spindle activity as observed in experiments. 8. The spatiotemporal properties of propagating waves in the model were highly dependent on the intrinsic properties of TC cells. The spatial pattern of spiking activity was markedly different for spindles compared with bicuculline-induced oscillations and depended on the rebound burst behavior of TC cells. The upregulation of Ih produced a refractory period so that colliding spindle waves merged into a single oscillation and extinguished. Finally, reducing the Ih conductance led to sustained oscillations. 9. Two key properties of cells in the thalamic network may account for the initiation, propagation, and termination of spindle oscillations, the activity-dependent upregulation of Ih in TC cells, and the localized axonal projections between TC and RE cells. In addition, the model predicts that a nonlinear stimulus dependency of GABAB responses accounts for the genesis of prolonged synchronized discharges following block of GABAA receptors."}], "ArticleTitle": "Ionic mechanisms underlying synchronized oscillations and propagating waves in a model of ferret thalamic slices."}, "11744242": {"mesh": ["Action Potentials", "Animals", "Cats", "Cell Compartmentation", "Dendrites", "Glutamic Acid", "Ion Channels", "Models, Neurological", "Neocortex", "Nerve Net", "Neural Inhibition", "Organ Culture Techniques", "Patch-Clamp Techniques", "Pyramidal Cells", "Rats", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Receptors, AMPA", "Stochastic Processes", "Synapses", "Synaptic Transmission", "Tetrodotoxin", "gamma-Aminobutyric Acid"], "AbstractText": [{"section": null, "text": "To investigate the basis of the fluctuating activity present in neocortical neurons in vivo, we have combined computational models with whole-cell recordings using the dynamic-clamp technique.

Variations in action potential waveform can influence neuronal discharges by the differential activation of voltage- and ion-gated channels long after the end of a spike. One component of the action potential waveform, the afterhyperpolarization (AHP), is generally considered an inhibitory mechanism for limiting firing rates. In dentate gyrus granule cells (DGCs) expressing fast-gated BK channels, large fast AHPs (fAHP) are paradoxically associated with increased gain. In this article, we describe a mechanism for this behavior using a computational model. Hyperpolarization provided by the fAHP enhances activation of a dendritic inward current (a T-type Ca2+ channel is suggested) that, in turn, boosts rebound depolarization at the soma. The model suggests that the fAHP may both reduce Ca2+ channel inactivation and, counterintuitively, enhance its activation. The magnitude of the rebound depolarization, in turn, determines the activation of a subsequent, slower inward current (a persistent Na+ current is suggested) limiting the interspike interval. Simulations also show that the effect of AHP on gain is also effective for physiologically relevant stimulation; varying AHP amplitude affects interspike interval across a range of \"noisy\" stimulus frequency and amplitudes.

Furthermore, D1 but not D2 MSNs showed marked proliferative changes to their dendritic arbors and reductions in spine density. Immunohistochemical assessment showed no loss of glutamatergic afferent inputs from cortical and subcortical sources onto identified D1 and D2 MSNs.

We simulated a neuron-astrocyte network model to investigate how top-down, feedback signaling from a motor network (Nmot) to a sensory network (Nsen) affects perceptual judgments in association with ambient (extracellular) GABA levels. In the Nsen, astrocytic transporters modulated ambient GABA levels around pyramidal cells. A simple perceptual task was implemented: detection of a feature stimulus presented to the Nsen. The Nmot showed distinct perceptual behaviors: hit, fault, and miss. A hit is a correct response to the stimulus, a fault is a wrong response to the stimulus, and a miss is no response to the stimulus. In hits, the feedback signaling increased the gain of Nsen pyramidal cells and accelerated the reaction speed of Nmot pyramidal cells to the stimulus. Without feedback signaling, the Nsen but not Nmot responded to the stimulus, resulting in a miss. With too strong feedback signaling, the Nmot resulted in a fault, namely, stimulus-insensitive but not stimulus-sensitive pyramidal cells wrongly responded. Balancing the feedforward and feedback signaling formed a coherent, ongoing-spontaneous neuronal state, by which the highest hit rate was achieved.

Contemporary methods of quantifying the common input to motor neurons rely on compiling discrete action potentials into continuous time series, assuming the motor pool acts as a linear filter, and requiring signals to be of sufficient duration for frequency analysis. We introduce a space-state model in which the discharge activity of motor neurons is modeled as inhomogeneous Poisson processes and propose a method to quantify an abstract latent trajectory that represents the common input received by motor neurons.

In these experiments, the cortical LFP is measured by multielectrodes covering several cortical lamina and averaged on spontaneous spikes of thalamocortical (TC) cells. Using a well established forward-modeling scheme, we investigated the biophysical origin of this stLFP signature with simultaneous synaptic activation of cortical layer-4 neurons, mimicking the effect of a single afferent spike from a single TC neuron. Constrained by previously measured intracellular responses of the main postsynaptic target cell types and with biologically plausible assumptions regarding the spatial distribution of thalamic synaptic inputs into layer 4, the model predicted characteristic contributions to monosynaptic stLFP signatures both for the regular-spiking (RS) excitatory neurons and the fast-spiking (FS) inhibitory interneurons. In particular, the FS cells generated stLFP signatures of shorter temporal duration than the RS cells. Added together, a sum of the stLFP signatures of these two principal synaptic targets of TC cells were observed to resemble experimentally measured stLFP signatures. Outside the volume targeted by TC afferents, the resulting postsynaptic LFP signals were found to be sharply attenuated. This implies that such stLFP signatures provide a very local measure of TC synaptic activation, and that newly developed inverse current-source density (CSD)-estimation methods are needed for precise assessment of the underlying spatiotemporal CSD profiles.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Despite its long history and prevalent use, the proper interpretation of the extracellularly recorded local field potential (LFP) is still not fully established.

Our results hold for a monotonically increasing (meaning longer delays as the phase increases) PRC, which likely characterizes inhibitory fast-spiking basket and cortical low-threshold-spiking interneurons in response to strong inhibition. Conduction delays stabilize synchrony for this PRC shape, whereas they destroy two-cluster states, the former by avoiding a destabilizing discontinuity and the latter by approaching it. With conduction delays, stronger coupling strength can promote a one-cluster state, so the weak coupling limit is not applicable here. We show how jitter can destabilize global synchrony but not a two-cluster state. Local stability of global synchrony in an all-to-all network does not guarantee that global synchrony can be observed in an appropriately scaled sparsely connected network; the basin of attraction can be inferred from the PRC and must be sufficiently large. Two-cluster synchrony is not obviously different from one-cluster synchrony in the presence of noise and may be the actual substrate for oscillations observed in the local field potential (LFP) and the electroencephalogram (EEG) in situations where global synchrony is not possible.

J Neurophysiol 113: 2420-2433, 2015). To understand how differences in terminal morphology and the resulting hair cell inputs might affect afferent response properties, we modeled representative afferents from each region, using reconstructed bouton afferents. Collecting area and hair cell density were used to estimate hair cell-to-afferent convergence. Nonmorphological features were held constant to isolate effects of afferent structure and connectivity. The models suggest that all four bouton afferent types are electrotonically compact and that excitatory postsynaptic potentials are two to four times larger in MES afferents than in other afferents, making MES afferents more responsive to low input levels. The models also predict that MES and LES terminal structures permit higher spontaneous firing rates than those in striola and juxtastriola. We found that differences in spike train regularity are not a consequence of differences in peripheral terminal structure, per se, but that a higher proportion of multiple contacts between afferents and individual hair cells increases afferent firing irregularity. The prediction that afferents having primarily one bouton contact per hair cell will fire more regularly than afferents making multiple bouton contacts per hair cell has implications for spike train regularity in dimorphic and calyx afferents.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Bouton afferents in different regions of turtle utricle have very different morphologies and afferent-hair cell connectivities.

In the Gaussian-Gaussian (GG) model, both the connection probability and the strength are given as Gaussian distribution as a function of spatial distance. In the Uniform-Constant (UC) and Uniform-Exponential (UE) models, the connection probability density is a uniform constant within a certain range, but the connection strength is set as a constant value or an exponentially decaying function, respectively.

We observed that the synchronization-dependent modulation of the transfer function appeared noticeably different for each convergence condition. The modulation of the spike transfer function was largest in the UC model, and smallest in the UE model. Our analysis showed that this difference was induced by the different spike weight distributions that was generated from convergent synapses in each model.

Cortical evoked potentials (cEP) generated by STN DBS reflect the response of cortex to subcortical stimulation, and the goal of this study was to determine the neural origin of STN DBS-generated cEP using a two-step approach. First, we recorded cEP over ipsilateral primary motor cortex during different frequencies of STN DBS in awake healthy and unilateral 6-OHDA-lesioned parkinsonian rats. Second, we used a detailed, biophysically based model of the thalamocortical network to deconstruct the neural origin of the recorded cEP. The in vivo cEP included short (R1)-, intermediate (R2)-, and long-latency (R3) responses. Model-based cortical responses to simulated STN DBS matched remarkably well the in vivo responses. The short-latency response was generated by antidromic activation of layer 5 pyramidal neurons, whereas recurrent activation of layer 5 pyramidal neurons via excitatory axon collaterals reproduced the intermediate-latency response. The long-latency response was generated by polysynaptic activation of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons via the cortico-thalamic-cortical pathway. Antidromic activation of the hyperdirect pathway and subsequent intracortical and cortico-thalamo-cortical synaptic interactions were sufficient to generate cortical potential evoked by STN DBS, and orthodromic activation through basal ganglia-thalamus-cortex pathways was not required. These results demonstrate the utility of cEP to determine the neural elements activated by STN DBS that might modulate cortical activity and contribute to the suppression of parkinsonian symptoms. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) is increasingly used to treat Parkinson's disease (PD). Cortical potentials evoked by STN DBS in patients with PD exhibit consistent short-latency (1-3 ms), intermediate-latency (5-15 ms), and long-latency (18-25 ms) responses. The short-latency response occurs as a result of antidromic activation of the hyperdirect pathway comprising corticosubthalamic axons. However, the neural origins of intermediate- and long-latency responses remain elusive, and the dominant view is that these are produced through the orthodromic pathway (basal ganglia-thalamus-cortex). By combining in vivo electrophysiology with computational modeling, we demonstrate that antidromic activation of the cortico-thalamic-cortical pathway is sufficient to generate the intermediate- and long-latency cortical responses to STN DBS."}], "ArticleTitle": "Model-based deconstruction of cortical evoked potentials generated by subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation."}}, "244384": {"30858799": {"mesh": ["Computer Simulation", "Dopaminergic Neurons", "Excitatory Amino Acid Agonists", "Glutamic Acid", "Humans", "Models, Neurological", "Parkinson Disease"], "AbstractText": [{"section": null, "text": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease associated with progressive and inexorable loss of dopaminergic cells in Substantia Nigra pars compacta (SNc).

One of these mechanisms is the peculiar metabolic vulnerability of SNc cells compared to other dopaminergic clusters; the other is the SubThalamic Nucleus (STN)-induced excitotoxicity in SNc. To investigate the latter hypothesis computationally, we developed a spiking neuron network-model of SNc-STN-GPe system. In the model, prolonged stimulation of SNc cells by an overactive STN leads to an increase in 'stress' variable; when the stress in a SNc neuron exceeds a stress threshold, the neuron dies. The model shows that the interaction between SNc and STN involves a positive-feedback due to which, an initial loss of SNc cells that crosses a threshold causes a runaway-effect, leading to an inexorable loss of SNc cells, strongly resembling the process of neurodegeneration. The model further suggests a link between the two aforementioned mechanisms of SNc cell loss.

The neurotrophin Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) is known to promote structural and functional synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus, the cerebral cortex, and many other brain areas. In recent years, a wealth of data has been accumulated revealing the paramount importance of BDNF for neuronal function. BDNF signaling gives rise to multiple complex signaling pathways that mediate neuronal survival and differentiation during development, and formation of new memories. These different roles of BDNF for neuronal function have essential consequences if BDNF signaling in the brain is reduced. Thus, BDNF knock-out mice or mice that are deficient in BDNF receptor signaling via TrkB and p75 receptors show deficits in neuronal development, synaptic plasticity, and memory formation. Accordingly, BDNF signaling dysfunctions are associated with many neurological and neurodegenerative conditions including Alzheimer's and Huntington's disease. However, despite the widespread implications of BDNF-dependent signaling in synaptic plasticity in healthy and pathological conditions, the interplay of the involved different biochemical pathways at the synaptic level remained mostly unknown.

Such a model can guide the rational design of new ion channel functionality tailored to different cell types/tissues. Focusing on one of the most widely used ChR2 mutants (H134R) with enhanced current, we collected a comprehensive experimental data set of the response of this ion channel to different irradiances and voltages, and used these data to develop a model of ChR2 with empirically-derived voltage- and irradiance- dependence, where parameters were fine-tuned via simulated annealing optimization.

We used a combination of computational modeling and in vitro electrophysiology in hippocampal slices of male rats to test whether CA1 neurons responded to SC stimulation selectively at slow gamma frequencies and to identify the mechanisms involved. Both approaches demonstrated that, in response to temporally precise input at SCs, CA1 pyramidal neurons fire preferentially in the slow gamma range regardless of whether the input is at fast or slow gamma frequencies, suggesting frequency selectivity in CA1 output with respect to CA3 input. In addition, phase locking, assessed by the vector strength, was more precise for slow gamma than fast gamma input. This frequency selectivity was greatly attenuated when the slow Ca2+-dependent K+ (SK) current was removed from the model or blocked in vitro with apamin. Perfusion of slices with BaCl2 to block A-type K+ channels tightened this frequency selectivity. Both the broad-spectrum cholinergic agonist carbachol and the muscarinic agonist oxotremorine-M greatly attenuated the selectivity.

Still, considerable variability exists in the presence and magnitude of the notch across neurons. To systematically address the contribution of AIS, dendritic and somatic compartments to shaping the two-component APs, we modeled APs of previously in vivo electrophysiologically characterized and 3D-reconstructed male mouse and rat dopaminergic neurons. A parsimonious two-domain model, with high (AIS) and lower (dendro-somatic) Na+ conductance, reproduced the notch in the temporal derivatives, but not in the extracellular APs, regardless of morphology. The notch was only revealed when somatic active currents were reduced, constraining the model to three domains. Thus, an initial AIS spike is followed by an actively generated spike by the axon-bearing dendrite (ABD), in turn followed mostly passively by the soma. The transition from being a source compartment for the AIS spike to a source compartment for the ABD spike satisfactorily explains the extracellular somatic notch. Larger AISs and thinner ABD (but not soma-to-AIS distance) accentuate the AIS component.

The ways in which these two opposing processes interact to establish L-LTP are not well understood, however. For example, L-LTP is attenuated by inhibiting either protein synthesis or proteasome-dependent degradation prior to and during a tetanic stimulus (e.g., Huang et&#160;al., 1996; Karpova et&#160;al., 2006), but paradoxically, L-LTP is not attenuated when synthesis and degradation are inhibited simultaneously (Fonseca&#160;et&#160;al.,&#160;2006). These paradoxical results suggest that counter-acting 'positive' and 'negative' proteins regulate L-LTP. To investigate the basis of this paradox, we developed a model of LTP at the Schaffer collateral to CA1 pyramidal cell synapse. The model consists of nine ordinary differential equations that describe the levels of both positive- and negative-regulator proteins (PP and NP, respectively) and the transitions among five discrete synaptic states, including a basal state (BAS), three states corresponding to E-LTP (EP1, EP2, and ED), and a L-LTP state (LP). An LTP-inducing stimulus: 1) initiates the transition from BAS to EP1 and from EP1 to EP2; 2) initiates the synthesis of PP and NP; and finally; 3) activates the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), which in turn, mediates transitions of EP1 and EP2 to ED and the degradation of NP. The conversion of E-LTP to L-LTP is mediated by the PP-dependent transition from ED to LP, whereas NP mediates reversal of EP2 to BAS. We found that the inclusion of the five discrete synaptic states was necessary to simulate key empirical observations: 1) normal L-LTP, 2) block of L-LTP by either proteasome inhibitor or protein synthesis inhibitor alone, and 3) preservation of L-LTP when both inhibitors are applied together.

Recent publications have shown that Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is required for LTD induction.

This study focuses on caffeine-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations in sympathetic neurons. Previous work has shown that these oscillations require Ca2+ entry from the extracellular medium and Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release from a caffeine- and ryanodine-sensitive store. The aim of the study was to understand the mechanism responsible for the oscillations. As a starting point, [Ca2+]i relaxations were examined after membrane depolarization and exposure to caffeine. For both stimuli, post-stimulus relaxations could be described by the sum of two decaying exponential functions, consistent with a one-pool system in which Ca2+ transport between compartments is regulated by linear Ca2+ pumps and leaks. After modifying the store to include a [Ca2+]i-sensitive leak, the model also exhibits oscillations such as those observed experimentally. The model was tested by comparing measured and predicted net Ca2+ fluxes during the oscillatory cycle. Three independent fluxes were measured, describing the rates of 1) Ca2+ entry across the plasma membrane, 2) Ca2+ release by the internal store, and 3) Ca2+ extrusion across the plasma membrane and uptake by the internal store. Starting with estimates of the model parameters deduced from post-stimulus relaxations and the rapid upstroke, a set of parameter values was found that provides a good description of [Ca2+]i throughout the oscillatory cycle. With the same parameter values, there was also good agreement between the measured and simulated net fluxes. Thus, a one-pool model with a single [Ca2+]i-sensitive Ca2+ permeability is adequate to account for many of the quantitative properties of steady-state [Ca2+]i oscillations in sympathetic neurons.

It has been suggested that the interburst hyperpolarization is due to Na+ extrusion by a ouabain-sensitive pump [Johnson et al. (1992) Science 258, 665-667]. We formulate and explore a theoretical model, with a minimal number of currents, for this novel mechanism of burst generation. This minimal model is further developed into a more elaborate model based on observations of additional currents and hypotheses about their spatial distribution in dopaminergic neurons [Hounsgaard (1992) Neuroscience 50, 513-518; Llin&#225;s et al. (1984) Brain Res. 294, 127-132]. Using the minimal model, we confirm that interaction between the regenerative, inward N-methyl-D-aspartate-mediated current and the outward Na(+)-pump current is sufficient to generate the slow oscillation (approximately 0.5 Hz) underlying the burst. The negative-slope region of the N-methyl-D-aspartate channel's current-voltage relation is indispensable for this slow rhythm generation. The time-scale of Na(+)-handling determines the burst's slow frequency. Moreover, we show that, given the constraints of sodium handling, such bursting is best explained mechanistically by using at least two spatial, cable-like compartments: a soma where action potentials are produced and a dendritic compartment where the slow rhythm is generated. Our result is consistent with recent experimental evidence that burst generation originates in distal dendrites [Seutin et al. (1994) Neuroscience 58, 201-206]. Responses of the model to a number of electrophysiological and pharmacological stimuli are consistent with known responses observed under similar conditions. These include the persistence of the slow rhythm when the tetrodotoxin-sensitive Na+ channel is blocked and when the soma is voltage-clamped at -60 mV. Using our more elaborate model, we account for details of the observed frequency adaptation in N-methyl-D-aspartate-induced bursting, the origin of multiple spiking and bursting mechanisms, and the interaction between two different bursting mechanisms. Besides reproducing several well established firing patterns, this model also suggests that new firing modes, not yet recorded, might also occur in dopaminergic neurons. This model provides mechanistic insights and explanations into the origin of a variety of experimentally observed membrane potential firing patterns in dopaminergic neurons, including N-methyl-D-aspartate-induced bursting and its dendritic origin. Such a model, capable of reproducing a number of realistic behaviors of dopaminergic neurons, could be useful in further studies of the basal ganglia-thalamocortical motor circuit.

The localization of the main molecular actors and the geometry of the system, including the spatial organization of calcium channels IP3R, are deemed essential. However, as most calcium signals occur in astrocytic ramifications that are too fine to be resolved by conventional light microscopy, most of those spatial data are unknown and computational modeling remains the only methodology to study this issue. Here, we propose an IP3R-mediated calcium signaling model for dynamics in such small sub-cellular volumes.

Extensive simulations show that spontaneous calcium signals arise in the model via the interplay between excitability and stochasticity.

Here, we incorporate newly revealed subgroups of neurons within the GPe into an existing computational model of the basal ganglia, and investigate their role in action selection. Three main results ensued. First, using previously used metrics for selection, the new extended connectivity improved the action selection performance of the model. Second, low frequency theta oscillations were observed in the subpopulation of the GPe (the TA or 'arkypallidal' neurons) which project exclusively to the striatum. These oscillations were suppressed by increased dopamine activity -&#160;revealing a possible link with symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Third, a new phenomenon was observed in which the usual monotonic relationship between input to the basal ganglia and its output within an action 'channel' was, under some circumstances, reversed. Thus, at high levels of input, further increase of this input to the channel could cause an increase of the corresponding output rather than the more usually observed decrease. Moreover, this phenomenon was associated with the prevention of multiple channel selection, thereby assisting in optimal action selection. Examination of the mechanistic origin of our results showed the so-called 'prototypical' GPe neurons to be the principal subpopulation influencing action selection.

Muscarinic receptor activation enables persistent spiking among synaptically isolated pyramidal neurons in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), but a detailed characterization of that spiking is lacking and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that the rate of persistent spiking in ACC neurons is insensitive to the intensity and number of triggers, but can be modulated by injected current, and that persistent spiking can resume after several seconds of hyperpolarization-imposed quiescence. Using electrophysiology and calcium imaging in brain slices from male rats, we determined that canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC) channels are necessary for persistent spiking and that TRPC-activating calcium enters in a spike-dependent manner via voltage-gated calcium channels. Constrained by these biophysical details, we built a computational model that reproduced the observed pattern of persistent spiking. Nonlinear dynamical analysis of that model revealed that TRPC channels become fully activated by the small rise in intracellular calcium caused by evoked spikes. Calcium continues to rise during persistent spiking, but because TRPC channel activation saturates, firing rate stabilizes. By calcium rising higher than required for maximal TRPC channel activation, TRPC channels are able to remain active during periods of hyperpolarization-imposed quiescence (until calcium drops below saturating levels) such that persistent spiking can resume when hyperpolarization is discontinued. Our results thus reveal that the robust intrinsic bistability exhibited by ACC neurons emerges from the nonlinear positive feedback relationship between spike-dependent calcium influx and TRPC channel activation.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Neurons use action potentials, or spikes, to encode information. Some neurons can store information for short periods (seconds to minutes) by continuing to spike after a stimulus ends, thus enabling working memory.

However, TRPC activation alone is insufficient to explain many aspects of persistent spiking such as resumption of spiking after periods of imposed quiescence.

We examined the biophysical models used to substantiate this view, and we found that spikes do not initiate through a local axonal current loop that propagates along the axon, but through a global current loop encompassing the AIS and soma, which forms an electrical dipole. Therefore, the phenomenon is not adequately modeled as the backpropagation of an electrical wave along the axon, since the wavelength would be as large as the entire system. Instead, in these models, we found that spike initiation rather follows the critical resistive coupling model proposed recently, where the Na current entering the AIS is matched by the axial resistive current flowing to the soma. Besides demonstrating it by examining the balance of currents at spike initiation, we show that the observed increase in spike sharpness along the axon is artifactual and disappears when an appropriate measure of rapidness is used; instead, somatic onset rapidness can be predicted from spike shape at initiation site.

Sparsening transformations are thought to increase the separation between similar representations, encode stimuli with great specificity, maximize storage capacity of associative memories, and provide an energy efficient instantiation of information in neural circuits. In the insect olfactory system, odors are initially represented in the periphery as a combinatorial code with relatively simple temporal dynamics. Subsequently, in the antennal lobe this representation is transformed into a dense and complex spatiotemporal activity pattern. Next, in the mushroom body Kenyon cells (KCs), the representation is dramatically sparsened. Finally, in mushroom body output neurons (MBONs), the representation takes on a new dense spatiotemporal format. Here, we develop a computational model to simulate this chain of olfactory processing from the receptor neurons to MBONs. We demonstrate that representations of similar odorants are maximally separated, measured by the distance between the corresponding MBON activity vectors, when KC responses are sparse. Sparseness is maintained across variations in odor concentration by adjusting the feedback inhibition that KCs receive from an inhibitory neuron, the Giant GABAergic neuron. Different odor concentrations require different strength and timing of feedback inhibition for optimal processing. Importantly, as observed in vivo, the KC-MBON synapse is highly plastic, and, therefore, changes in synaptic strength after learning can change the balance of excitation and inhibition, potentially leading to changes in the distance between MBON activity vectors of two odorants for the same level of KC population sparseness. Thus, what is an optimal degree of sparseness before odor learning, could be rendered sub-optimal post learning.

We have shown that potentiation of corticostriatal synapses enables learning of a rewarded option. However, these synapses became redundant later as direct connections between prefrontal and premotor cortices (PFC-PMC) were potentiated by Hebbian learning. After we switched the reward to the previously unrewarded option (reversal), the BG was again responsible for switching to the new option. Due to the potentiated direct cortical connections, the system was biased to the previously rewarded choice, and establishing the new choice required a greater number of trials. Guided by physiological research, we then modified our model to reproduce pathological states of mild Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases. We found that in the Parkinsonian state PMC activity levels become extremely variable, which is caused by oscillations arising in the BG-thalamo-cortical loop. The model reproduced severe impairment of learning and predicted that this is caused by these oscillations as well as a reduced reward prediction signal. In the Huntington state, the potentiation of the PFC-PMC connections produced better learning, but altered BG output disrupted expression of the rewarded choices. This resulted in random switching between rewarded and unrewarded choices resembling an exploratory phase that never ended. Along with other computational studies, our results further reconcile the apparent contradiction between the critical involvement of the BG in execution of previously learned actions and yet no impairment of these actions after BG output is ablated by lesions or deep brain stimulation.

This is of particular importance given recent demonstrations that movement direction, which is essential for path integration, cannot be recovered from head direction cell firing rates. In addition, we investigate how firing phase might reduce errors in decoded location, including those arising from differences in firing rate across grid fields.

In pyramidal cells of the parietal cortex (area 5-7), synaptic activity was responsible for an approximately fivefold decrease in input resistance (Rin), a more depolarized membrane potential (Vm), and a marked increase in the amplitude of Vm fluctuations, as determined by comparing the same cells before and after microperfusion of tetrodotoxin (TTX). The model was constrained by measurements of Rin, by the average value and standard deviation of the Vm measured from epochs of intense synaptic activity recorded with KAc or KCl-filled pipettes as well as the values measured in the same cells after TTX. To reproduce all experimental results, the simulated synaptic activity had to be of relatively high frequency (1-5 Hz) at excitatory and inhibitory synapses. In addition, synaptic inputs had to be significantly correlated (correlation coefficient approximately 0.1) to reproduce the amplitude of Vm fluctuations recorded experimentally. The presence of voltage-dependent K+ currents, estimated from current-voltage relations after TTX, affected these parameters by <10%. The model predicts that the conductance due to synaptic activity is 7-30 times larger than the somatic leak conductance to be consistent with the approximately fivefold change in Rin. The impact of this massive increase in conductance on dendritic attenuation was investigated for passive neurons and neurons with voltage-dependent Na+/K+ currents in soma and dendrites. In passive neurons, correlated synaptic bombardment had a major influence on dendritic attenuation. The electrotonic attenuation of simulated synaptic inputs was enhanced greatly in the presence of synaptic bombardment, with distal synapses having minimal effects at the soma. Similarly, in the presence of dendritic voltage-dependent currents, the convergence of hundreds of synaptic inputs was required to evoke action potentials reliably. In this case, however, dendritic voltage-dependent currents minimized the variability due to input location, with distal apical synapses being as effective as synapses on basal dendrites.

To integrate efficient methods for studying this heterogeneity, we built a single-compartment, Hodgkin-Huxley-type model of an SFO neuron that is parameterized by SFO-specific in vitro patch-clamp data. The model accounts for the membrane potential distribution and spike train variability of both tonic and burst firing SFO neurons.

In addition to the role of NCX at the synapse of hippocampal subfields required for LTP, the three NCX isoforms have also been shown to localize to the dendrite of hippocampal pyramidal cells. In the case of NCX1, it has been shown to localize throughout the basal and apical dendrite of CA1 neurons where it helps compartmentalize Ca2+ between dendritic shafts and spines. Given the role for NCX and calcium in synaptic plasticity, the capacity of NCX splice-forms to influence backpropagating action potentials has clear consequences for the induction of spike-timing dependent synaptic plasticity (STDP). To explore this, we examined the effect of NCX localization, density, and allosteric activation on forward and back propagating signals and, next employed a STDP paradigm to monitor the effect of NCX on plasticity using back propagating action potentials paired with EPSPs. From our simulation studies we identified a role for the sodium calcium exchange current in normalizing STDP, and demonstrate that NCX is required at the postsynaptic site for this response. We also screened other mechanisms in our model and identified a role for the Ca2+ activated K+ current at the postsynapse in producing STDP responses.

These findings have led some to hypothesize that this interneuronal activity may serve a causal role in driving the sudden change in brain activity that heralds seizure onset. However, the mechanisms predisposing an inhibitory network toward increased activity, specifically prior to ictogenesis, without a permanent change to inputs to the system remain unknown. We address this question by comparing simulated inhibitory networks containing control interneurons and networks containing hyperexcitable interneurons modeled to mimic treatment with 4-Aminopyridine (4-AP), an agent commonly used to model seizures in vivo and in vitro. Our in silico study demonstrates that model inhibitory networks with 4-AP interneurons are more prone than their control counterparts to exist in a bistable state in which asynchronously firing networks can abruptly transition into synchrony driven by a brief perturbation. This transition into synchrony brings about a corresponding increase in overall firing rate. We further show that perturbations driving this transition could arise in vivo from background excitatory synaptic activity in the cortex. Thus, we propose that bistability explains the increase in interneuron activity observed experimentally prior to seizure via a transition from incoherent to coherent dynamics. Moreover, bistability explains why inhibitory networks containing hyperexcitable interneurons are more vulnerable to this change in dynamics, and how such networks can undergo a transition without a permanent change in the drive. We note that while our comparisons are between networks of control and ictogenic neurons, the conclusions drawn specifically relate to the unusual dynamics that arise prior to seizure, and not seizure onset itself.

Together, our results suggest that differences in BK channel expression may underlie the differences in electrical activity and basal hormone secretion levels among pituitary cell types and that the rapid rate of BK channel activation is key to its role in burst promotion."}], "ArticleTitle": "Fast-activating voltage- and calcium-dependent potassium (BK) conductance promotes bursting in pituitary cells: a dynamic clamp study."}}, "266657": {"32463356": {"mesh": ["Animals", "Benzylamines", "Computer Simulation", "Electrophysiological Phenomena", "Immunohistochemistry", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Transgenic", "Neocortex", "Patch-Clamp Techniques", "Phosphinic Acids", "Pyramidal Cells"], "AbstractText": [{"section": null, "text": "Anatomical similarity across the neocortex has led to the common assumption that the circuitry is modular and performs stereotyped computations.

Here, we demonstrate that computations associated with dendritic Ca2+ plateaus in mouse L5PNs vary substantially between the primary and secondary visual cortices. L5PNs in the secondary visual cortex show reduced dendritic excitability and smaller propensity for burst firing. This reduced excitability is correlated with shorter apical dendrites. Using numerical modelling, we uncover a universal principle underlying the influence of apical length on dendritic backpropagation and excitability, based on a Na+ channel-dependent broadening of backpropagating action potentials.

We address these issues with a combination of optogenetic experiments and modeling studies. We used transgenic mice expressing channelrhodopsin-2 under the VGAT-promoter to investigate perturbations of respiratory circuit activity by site-specific photostimulation of inhibitory neurons within the pre-B&#246;tC or B&#246;tC. The stimulation effects were dependent on the intensity and phase of the photostimulation. Specifically: (1) Low intensity (&#8804; 1.0 mW) pulses delivered to the pre-B&#246;tC during inspiration did not terminate activity, whereas stronger stimulations (&#8805; 2.0 mW) terminated inspiration. (2) When the pre-B&#246;tC stimulation ended in or was applied during expiration, rebound activation of inspiration occurred after a fixed latency.

Some oscillations are tonic and last for seconds or even minutes. Other oscillations appear as unstable bursts. Likewise, some oscillations rely on excitatory AMPAergic synapses, but others are GABAergic and inhibitory. Why this diversity exists is not clear. We hypothesized Ca2+-dependent homeostasis could be important in finding an explanation. We tested this hypothesis in a highly simplified model of hippocampal neurons. In this model homeostasis profoundly alters the modulatory effect of neural oscillations. Under homeostasis, tonic AMPAergic oscillations actually decrease excitability and desynchronize firing. Tonic oscillations that are synaptically GABAergic-like those in real hippocampus-don't provoke a homeostatic response, however. If our simple model is correct, homeostasis can explain why the theta rhythm in the hippocampus is synaptically inhibitory: GABA has little to no intrinsic homeostatic response and so can preserve the pyramidal cell's natural dynamic range. Based on these results we speculate that homeostasis may explain why AMPAergic oscillations in cortex, and in hippocampus, often appear as bursts. Bursts do not interact with the slow homeostatic time constant and so retain their normal excitatory effect.NEW & NOTEWORTHY The intricate interplay of neuromodulators, like acetylcholine, with homeostasis is well known. The interplay between oscillatory modulation and homeostasis is not. We studied oscillatory modulation and homeostasis for the first time using a simplified model of hippocampus. We report a paradoxical result: Ca-mediated homeostasis causes AMPAergic oscillations to become effectively inhibitory. This result, along with other new observations, means homeostasis might be just as complex and important for oscillations as it is for other neuromodulators."}], "ArticleTitle": "Homeostatic mechanisms may shape the type and duration of oscillatory modulation."}}, "266732": {"32269036": {"mesh": ["Feedback", "Motor Neurons", "Muscles"], "AbstractText": [{"section": null, "text": "The goal of this study is to investigate how the activation location of persistent inward current (PIC) over motoneuron dendrites is linked to motor output in the closed-loop motor unit. Here, a physiologically realistic model of a motor unit including afferent inputs from muscle spindles was comprehensively analyzed under intracellular stimulation at the soma and synaptic inputs over the dendrites during isometric contractions over a full physiological range of muscle lengths. The motor output of the motor unit model was operationally assessed by evaluating the rate of force development, the degree of force potentiation and the capability of self-sustaining force production. Simulations of the model motor unit demonstrated a tendency for a faster rate of force development, a greater degree of force potentiation, and greater capacity for self-sustaining force production under both somatic and dendritic stimulation of the motoneuron as the PIC channels were positioned farther from the soma along the path of motoneuron dendrites. Interestingly, these effects of PIC activation location on force generation significantly differed among different states of muscle length. The rate of force development and the degree of force potentiation were systematically modulated by the variation of PIC channel location for shorter-than-optimal muscles but not for optimal and longer-than-optimal muscles. Similarly, the warm-up behavior of the motor unit depended on the interplay between PIC channel location and muscle length variation.

The model demonstrates that a syncytium of electrically coupled astrocytes can maintain a physiological membrane potential in the presence of an elevated extracellular K(+) concentration and efficiently distribute the excess K(+) across the syncytium.

We have developed a 19-compartment cable model of a guinea pig CA3 pyramidal neuron. Each compartment is allowed to contain six active ionic conductances: gNa, gCa, gK(DR) (where DR stands for delayed rectifier), gK(A), gK(AHP), and gK(C). THe conductance gCa is of the high-voltage activated type. The model kinetics for the first five of these conductances incorporate voltage-clamp data obtained from isolated hippocampal pyramidal neurons. The kinetics of gK(C) are based on data from bullfrog sympathetic neurons. The time constant for decay of submembrane calcium derives from optical imaging of Ca signals in Purkinje cell dendrites. 2. To construct the model from available voltage-clamp data, we first reproduced current-clamp records from a model isolated neuron (soma plus proximal dendrites). We next assumed that ionic channel kinetics in the dendrites were the same as in the soma. In accord with dendritic recordings and calcium-imaging data, we also assumed that significant gCa occurs in dendrites. We then attached sections of basilar and apical dendritic cable. By trial and error, we found a distribution (not necessarily unique) of ionic conductance densities that was consistent with current-clamp records from the soma and dendrites of whole neurons and from isolated apical dendrites. 3. The resulting model reproduces the Ca(2+)-dependent spike depolarizing afterpotential (DAP) recorded after a stimulus subthreshold for burst elicitation. 4. The model also reproduces the behavior of CA3 pyramidal neurons injected with increasing somatic depolarizing currents: low-frequency (0.3-1.0 Hz) rhythmic bursting for small currents, with burst frequency increasing with current magnitude; then more irregular bursts followed by afterhyperpolarizations (AHPs) interspersed with brief bursts without AHPs; and finally, rhythmic action potentials without bursts. 5. The model predicts the existence of still another firing pattern during tonic depolarizing dendritic stimulation: brief bursts at less than 1 to approximately 12 Hz, a pattern not observed during somatic stimulation. These bursts correspond to rhythmic dendritic calcium spikes. 6. The model CA3 pyramidal neuron can be made to resemble functionally a CA1 pyramidal neuron by increasing gK(DR) and decreasing dendritic gCa and gK(C). Specifically, after these alterations, tonic depolarization of the soma leads to adapting repetitive firing, whereas stimulation of the distal dendrites leads to bursting. 7.
